\section{Ena/VASP mechanisms}\label{ena-mechanism-conclusions}
Understanding the mechanism of formins and their regulation by protein binding partners as well as outside forces has taken a step forward in the last few years. Though they mechanistic understanding of Ena/VASP lags behind that of formins great progress is being made in understanding how Ena/VASP can be processive and how it is functioning within cells. There has been initial insight in how these two processive polymerases work together within cells, but much more needs to be done to understand their collaboration and concurrent regulation. These processive polymerases are mechanistically interesting to compare and contrast to understand how different proteins maintain actin filament contact as well as how they are regulated within the cell. Understanding their individual functions as well as how they work together will give a clearer picture of what is happening at filopodia and the leading edge of the cell.
