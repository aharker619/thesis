\acknowledgments
I would first like to acknowledge my advisor David Kovar for his guidance and support throughout my entire graduate school career. I would also like to thank past and present members of the Kovar Lab, specifically Katie Homa, Alisha Morganthaler, Cristian Suarez, Caitlin Anderson, Jenna Christensen, Dennis Zimmermann, Tom Burke, and Jon Winkelman for their scientific insights and making the Kovar Lab a fun, yet productive place. 

I also appreciate the support and friendship my molecular biosciences cohort has given me from when we started this journey during coursework and rotations through the stresses and celebrations that occur throughout graduate school. I would like to thank those who gave me scientific support but also those who support my hobbies and allowed me to maintain balance during graduate school. Specifically my BMB year has been an outstanding source of support and laughter. Beyond my year, I could always rely on other students to give advice, reagents, and 

My friends and family have given me unending support through my time at University of Chicago. I would specifically like to thank my parents and sister Emily for their encouragement and willingness to assist in any way. Also I would like to thank Corey who supports me in everything I do.
