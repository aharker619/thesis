	abstract = {Filamentous actin is organized into bundles and orthogonal networks by the fimbrin/α-actinin superfamily of F-actin crosslinking proteins. The crystal structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana and Schizosaccharomyces pombe fimbrin cores provides the first description of a functional F-actin crosslinking protein and highlights the compact and distinctly asymmetric organization of the fimbrin molecule, in which the two actin binding domains present distinct surfaces to solvent. The mapping of functionally important residues onto the structure affords new insights into the binding process and provides additional constraints which must be accommodated by models for F-actin binding and crosslinking. Most strikingly, this work provides unique insight into the mechanistic features of conditional-lethal mutants and their extragenic suppressors, which highlight conformational and dynamic properties required for fimbrin function. These results underscore the power of jointly considering structural and genetic suppressor data for obtaining unexpected and biologically relevant mechanistic information.},

	abstract = {A fragment of the yeast formin Bni1 containing the FH1FH2 domains increases the rate of filament nucleation from pure G-actin [Pruyne et al. (2002) Science 297, 612?615]. To determine the mechanism of nucleation, we compared the G-actin dependence of Bni1FH1FH2-induced polymerization with theoretical models. The data best fit a model suggesting that Bni1FH1FH2 stabilizes an actin dimer. We also show that nucleation increases with the square root of the Bni1FH1FH2 concentration. We demonstrate that this relationship is expected for any such nucleator, independent of nucleus size. The proline-rich FH1 domain binds profilin, and deletion of this domain decreases the contribution of profilin?actin to the nucleation. A role for profilin binding to the FH1 domain in filament nucleation was supported by the inability of Bni1FH1FH2 to utilize a mutant profilin, H133S profilin, with defective binding to polyproline. Bni1FH1FH2 partially inhibits barbed-end elongation, and we find that the rate constants for both polymerization and depolymerization are decreased by approximately 50\%. Bni1FH1FH2 has no effect on pointed-end kinetics or on the critical concentration. To investigate the domains of Bni1 required for these activities, the experiments were all duplicated with the FH2 domain alone. The FH2 domain is as effective as the FH1FH2 domains together in inhibiting barbed-end kinetics; it is less effective as a nucleator but the mechanism is again best fit by dimer stabilization.},

To modulate their mechanical properties, actin filaments can organize into a variety of architectures generating a diversity of cellular organizations including branched or crosslinked networks in the lamellipodium, parallel bundles in filopodia, and antiparallel structures in contractile fibers. In this review we describe the feedback loop between biochemical and mechanical properties of actin organization at the molecular level in vitro, then we integrate this knowledge into our current understanding of cellular actin organization and its physiological roles.},

Invertebrates have a single actinin-encoding ACTN gene, while mammals have four. Mutations in all four human genes have now been linked to heritable diseases or traits. ACTN1 mutations cause macrothrombocytopenia, a platelet disorder characterized by excessive bleeding. ACTN2 mutations have been linked to a range of cardiomyopathies, and ACTN4 mutations cause a kidney condition called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Intriguingly, approximately 16 \% of people worldwide are homozygous for a nonsense mutation in ACTN3 that abolishes actinin-3 protein expression. This ACTN3 null allele has undergone recent positive selection in specific human populations, which may be linked to improved endurance and adaptation to colder climates. In this review we discuss the human genetics of the ACTN gene family, as well as ACTN gene knockout studies in several model organisms.

To date, molecular structures of three dystrophin domains have been determined, of which the N-terminal actin-binding domain (N-ABD or ABD1) is of particular interest. This domain is composed of two calponin-homology (CH) domains, which form an important class of ABDs in muscle proteins. A previously determined x-ray structure indicates that the dystrophin N-ABD is a domain-swapped dimer, with each monomer adopting an extended, open conformation in which the two CH domains do not interact. This structure is controversial because it contradicts functional studies and known structures of similar ABDs from other muscle proteins. Here, we investigated the solution conformation of the dystrophin N-ABD using a very simple and elegant technique of pyrene excimer fluorescence. Using the wild-type protein, which contains two cysteines, and the corresponding single-cysteine mutants, we show that the protein is a monomer in solution and is in a closed conformation in which the two CH domains seem to interact, as observed from the excimer fluorescence of pyrene-labeled wild-type protein. Excimer fluorescence was also observed in its actin-bound form, indicating that the dystrophin N-ABD binds to F-actin in a closed conformation. Comparison of the dystrophin N-ABD conformation with other ABDs indicates that the tandem CH domains in general may be monomeric in solution and predominantly occur in closed conformation, whereas their actin-bound conformations may differ.},

The actin-binding domain (ABD) of these proteins consists of two consecutive calponin homology (CH) domains.

We have determined the 1.7A resolution structure of the ABD of alpha-actinin 1, a ubiquitously expressed isoform. The structure displays the classical compact conformation. We evaluated the two binding models by surface conservation analysis. The results show a conserved surface that spans both domains and corresponds to two previously identified actin-binding sites (ABS2 and ABS3). A third, and probably less important site, ABS1, is mostly buried in the compact conformation. However, a thorough examination of existing structures suggests a weak and semi-polar binding interface between the two CHs, leaving open the possibility of domain reorientation or opening. Our results are consistent with a two-step binding mechanism in which the ABD interacts first in the compact form observed in the structures, and then transitions toward a higher affinity state, possibly through minor rearrangement of the domains.},

Here, we describe how these different factors cooperate, directly or indirectly, to promote the assembly of functional actin network in cells, both in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm.

Formins are defined by a Formin Homology 2 (FH2) domain, as well as a proline-rich FH1 domain that binds the actin monomer binding protein, profilin, and other ligands [3]. Constructs including FH2 of budding yeast Bni1 or fission yeast Cdc12 formins nucleate actin filaments in vitro 4, 5, 6, 7. In this study, we demonstrate that FH2-containing constructs of murine mDia1 (also called p140 mDia or Drf1) are much more potent actin nucleators than the yeast formins. FH1 is necessary for nucleation when actin monomers are profilin bound. mDia1 is a member of the Diaphanous formin subfamily (Dia), whose members contain an N-terminal Rho GTPase binding domain (GBD) and a C-terminal Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD, [8]). Based on cellular and in vitro binding studies, an autoinhibitory model for Dia formin regulation proposes that GBD binding to DAD inhibits Dia-induced actin remodeling, whereas Rho binding activates by releasing GBD from DAD 9, 10. Supporting this model, our results show that an N-terminal mDia1 construct strongly inhibits actin nucleation by the C terminus. RhoA partially relieves inhibition but does so when bound to either GDP or GTP analogs. Both N- and C-terminal mDia1 constructs appear to be multimeric.},

A dimerization-impaired mutant of mDia2 (W630A) also generated stable MTs in cells. We examined whether FH1FH2mDia2 had direct activity on MTs in vitro and found that it bound directly to MTs, stabilized MTs against cold- and dilution-induced disassembly, and reduced the rates of growth and shortening during MT assembly and disassembly, respectively.

Thus, tissue-specific differences among tropomyosin isoforms may influence both access of actin-binding proteins along the actin filaments and the cooperativity of actin-myosin interactions. Here, 40 nm long smooth and striated muscle tropomyosin molecules were rotary-shadowed and compared by means of electron microscopy. Electron microscopy shows that striated muscle tropomyosin primarily consists of single molecules or paired molecules linked end-to-end. In contrast, smooth muscle tropomyosin is more a mixture of varying-length chains of end-to-end polymers. Both isoforms are characterized by gradually bending molecular contours that lack obvious signs of kinking. The flexural stiffness of the tropomyosins was quantified and evaluated. The persistence lengths along the shaft of rotary-shadowed smooth and striated muscle tropomyosin molecules are equivalent to each other (∼100 nm) and to values obtained from molecular-dynamics simulations of the tropomyosins; however, the persistence length surrounding the end-to-end linkage is almost twofold higher for smooth compared to cardiac muscle tropomyosin. The tendency of smooth muscle tropomyosin to form semi-rigid polymers with continuous and undampened rigidity may compensate for the lack of troponin-based structural support in smooth muscles and ensure positional fidelity on smooth muscle thin filaments.},

	abstract = {Filamentous actin (F-actin) is the major protein of muscle thin filaments, and actin microfilaments are the main component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Mutations in different actin isoforms lead to early-onset autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss1, familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections2, and multiple variations of myopathies3. In striated muscle fibres, the binding of myosin motors to actin filaments is mainly regulated by tropomyosin and troponin4,5. Tropomyosin also binds to F-actin in smooth muscle and in non-muscle cells and stabilizes and regulates the filaments there in the absence of troponin6. Although crystal structures for monomeric actin (G-actin) are available7, a high-resolution structure of F-actin is still missing, hampering our understanding of how disease-causing mutations affect the function of thin muscle filaments and microfilaments. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of F-actin at a resolution of 3.7 Å in complex with tropomyosin at a resolution of 6.5 Å, determined by electron cryomicroscopy. The structure reveals that the D-loop is ordered and acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that stabilize the F-actin filament. We clearly identify map density corresponding to ADP and Mg2+ and explain the possible effect of prominent disease-causing mutants. A comparison of F-actin with G-actin reveals the conformational changes during filament formation and identifies the D-loop as their key mediator. We also confirm that negatively charged tropomyosin interacts with a positively charged groove on F-actin. Comparison of the position of tropomyosin in F-actin–tropomyosin with its position in our previously determined F-actin–tropomyosin–myosin structure8 reveals a myosin-induced transition of tropomyosin. Our results allow us to understand the role of individual mutations in the genesis of actin- and tropomyosin-related diseases and will serve as a strong foundation for the targeted development of drugs.},

	abstract = {Profilin binds not only to actin monomers but also to the barbed end of the actin filament, where it inhibits association of subunits. To address open questions about the interactions of profilin with barbed ends, we measured the effects of a wide range of concentrations of Homo sapiens profilin 1 on the rate of elongation of individual skeletal muscle actin filaments by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Much higher concentrations of profilin were required to stop elongation by AMP-PNP-actin monomers than ADP-actin monomers. High concentrations of profilin depolymerized barbed ends at a rate much faster than the spontaneous dissociation rates of Mg-ATP-, Mg-AMP-PNP-, Mg-ADP-Pi-, and Mg-ADP-actin subunits. Fitting a thermodynamic model to these data allowed us to determine the affinities of profilin and profilin-actin for barbed ends and the influence of the nucleotide bound to actin on these interactions. Profilin has a much higher affinity for ADP-actin filament barbed ends (Kd = 1 μM) than AMP-PNP-actin filament barbed ends (Kd = 226 μM). ADP-actin monomers associated with profilin bind to ADP-actin filament barbed ends 10\% as fast as free ADP-actin monomers, but bound profilin does not affect the rate of association of AMP-PNP-actin monomers with barbed ends. The differences in the affinities of AMP-PNP- and ADP-bound barbed ends for profilin and profilin-actin suggest that conformations of barbed end subunits differ from those of monomers and change upon nucleotide hydrolysis and phosphate release. A structural model revealed minor steric clashes between profilin and actin subunits at the barbed end that explain the biochemical results.},

Previous work has identified two factors—the Arp2/3 complex and the formin family of proteins—that nucleate new actin filaments via different mechanisms. Here we show that the Drosophila protein Spire represents a third class of actin nucleation factor. In vitro, Spire nucleates new filaments at a rate that is similar to that of the formin family of proteins but slower than in the activated Arp2/3 complex, and it remains associated with the slow-growing pointed end of the new filament. Spire contains a cluster of four WASP homology 2 (WH2) domains, each of which binds an actin monomer. Maximal nucleation activity requires all four WH2 domains along with an additional actin-binding motif, conserved among Spire proteins. Spire itself is conserved among metazoans and, together with the formin Cappuccino, is required for axis specification in oocytes and embryos, suggesting that multiple actin nucleation factors collaborate to construct essential cytoskeletal structures.},

Formation of the complex inhibits salt-induced polymerization of G-actin. Here we report that Fx is indistinguishable from thymosin beta 4, an acidic, heat-stable 5-kDa peptide first isolated from calf thymus and thought to be a thymic hormone. The complete amino acid sequence of Fx was determined and was found to be identical with that of thymosin beta 4. Authentic thymosin beta 4 is functionally equivalent to Fx, forming a 1:1 complex with actin monomers and inhibiting polymerization. The widespread distribution and high intracellular concentration of thymosin beta 4 (Fx) strongly suggest that it plays a significant role in regulating actin polymerization in many cell types.},

Replacement of serine 38 with cysteine created a unique site where labeling with rhodamine did not alter the affinity of profilin for actin. The affinity for rabbit skeletal muscle actin is about 4-fold lower. The affinity for both actins is 5−8-fold lower with ADP bound to actin rather than ATP. Pyrenyliodoacetamide labeling of cysteine 374 of muscle actin reduces the affinity for profilin 10-fold. The affinity of profilin for nucleotide-free actin is ∼3-fold higher than for Mg-ATP-actin and ∼24-fold higher than for Mg-ADP-actin. As a result, profilin binding reduces the affinity of actin 3-fold for Mg-ATP and 24-fold for Mg-ADP. Mg-ATP dissociates 8 times faster from actin−profilin than from actin and binds actin−profilin 3 times faster than actin. Mg-ADP dissociates 14 times faster from actin−profilin than from actin and binds actin−profilin half as fast as actin. Thus, profilin promotes the exchange of ADP for ATP. These properties allow profilin to bind a high proportion of unpolymerized ATP-actin in the cell, suppressing spontaneous nucleation but allowing free barbed ends to elongate at more than 500 subunits/second.},

Animal cell movement is effected through a combination of protrusive and contractile events. Non-muscle cells contain stress fibres – bundles of actomyosin that are the major mediators of cell contraction and that can be compared to the highly organised actomyosin arrays of muscle cells. Recent studies have defined regulatory mechanisms that control stress fibre formation, placing the ROCK protein kinase at the centre of a complex signalling network controlling actomyosin contractility and stress fibre assembly. As we uncover the details of stress fibre construction, it is becoming clear that different categories of stress fibres exist. Some of these structures are less suited for cell motility and more suited to static contraction. In keeping with this, many specialised contractile cell types use stress fibres to remodel tissues and extracellular matrix.},

With improvements in the mechanics of the assay, it was possible to measure growth rates from 0.05 to 280 s-1. At 22 degrees C in 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM imidazole (pH 7), 0.2 mM ATP with 1 mM EGTA or 50 microM CaCl2 or with EGTA and 50 mM KCl, the elongation rates at both ends have a linear dependence on the ATP-actin concentration from the critical concentration to 20 microM. Consequently, over a wide range of subunit addition rates, the rate constants for association and dissociation of ATP-actin are constant. This shows that the nucleotide composition at or near the end of the growing filament is either the same over this range of growth rates or has no detectable effect on the rate constants. Under conditions where polymerization is fastest (MgCl2 + KCl + EGTA) the rate constants have these values: (table; see text) Compared with ATP-actin, ADP-actin associates slower at both ends, dissociates faster from the barbed end, but dissociates slower from the pointed end. Taking into account the events at both ends, these constants and a simple Oosawa-type model account for the complex three-phase dependence of the rate of polymerization in bulk samples on the concentration of ATP-actin monomers observed by Carlier, M.-F., D. Pantaloni, and E. D. Korn (1985, J. Biol. Chem., 260:6565-6571). These constants can also be used to predict the reactions at steady state in ATP. There will be slow subunit flux from the barbed end to the pointed end. There will also be minor fluctuations in length at the barbed end due to occasional rapid dissociation of strings of ADP subunits but the pointed end will be relatively stable.},

Subsequently, the Kaplan-Meier curves and estimates of survival data have become a familiar way of dealing with differing survival times (times-to-event), especially when not all the subjects continue in the study. “Survival” times need not relate to actual survival with death being the event; the “event” may be any event of interest. Kaplan-Meier analyses are also used in non-medical disciplines., The purpose of this paper is to explain how Kaplan-Meier curves are generated and analyzed. Throughout this article we will discuss Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates in the context of “survival” before the event of interest. Two small groups of hypothetical data are used as examples in order for the reader to clearly see how the process works. These examples also illustrate the crucially important point that comparative analysis depends upon the whole curve and not upon isolated points.},

Neither acp1 nor acp2 is required for viability, but cells lacking either or both subunits have cytokinesis defects under stressful conditions, including elevated temperature, osmotic stress, or in combination with numerous mild mutations in genes important for cytokinesis. Defects arise as the contractile ring constricts and disassembles, resulting in delays in cell separation. Genetic and biochemical interactions show that the cytokinesis formin Cdc12p competes with capping protein for actin filament barbed ends in cells. Deletion of acp2 partly suppresses cytokinesis defects in temperature-sensitive cdc12-112 cells and mild overexpression of capping protein kills cdc12-112 cells. Biochemically, profilin has opposite effects on filaments capped with Cdc12p and capping protein. Profilin depolymerizes actin filaments capped by capping protein but allows filaments capped by Cdc12p to grow at their barbed ends. Once associated with a barbed end, either Cdc12p or capping protein prevents the other from influencing polymerization at that end. Given that capping protein arrives at the division site 20 min later than Cdc12p, capping protein may slowly replace Cdc12p on filament barbed ends in preparation for filament disassembly during ring constriction.},

We isolated the unpolymerized actin from Xenopus egg extracts using immobilized DNase 1 and assayed the bound nucleotide. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed that the bulk of soluble actin is ATP bound. Analysis of actin-bound nucleotide exchange rates suggested the existence of two pools of unpolymerized actin, one of which exchanges nucleotide relatively rapidly and another that apparently does not exchange. Native gel electrophoresis of Xenopus egg extracts demonstrated that most of the soluble actin exists in complexes with other proteins, one of which might be thymosin beta 4. These results are consistent with actin polymerization being controlled by the sequestration and release of ATP-bound actin, and argue against nucleotide exchange playing a major role in regulating actin polymerization.},

Polymeric F-actin is formed by reversible noncovalent self-association of monomeric G-actin. To understand the dynamics of microfilament systems in cells, the dynamics of polymerization of pure actin must be understood. The following model has emerged from recent work. During the polymerization process, adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) that is bound to G-actin is hydrolyzed to adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) that is bound to F-actin. The hydrolysis reaction occurs on the F-actin subsequent to the polymerization reaction in two steps: cleavage of ATP followed by the slower release of inorganic phosphate (Pi). As a result, at high rates of filament growth a transient cap of ATP-actin subunits exists at the ends of elongating filaments, and at steady state a stabilizing cap of ADP.Pi-actin subunits exists at the barbed ends of filaments. Cleavage of ATP results in a highly stable filament with bound ADP.Pi, and release of Pi destabilizes the filament. Thus these two steps of the hydrolytic reaction provide potential mechanisms for regulating the monomer-polymer transition.},

	abstract = {The hydrolysis of ATP associated with actin and profilin-actin polymerization is pivotal in cell motility. It is at the origin of treadmilling of actin filaments and controls their dynamics and mechanical properties, as well as their interactions with regulatory proteins. The slow release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) that follows rapid cleavage of ATP gamma phosphate is linked to an increase in the rate of filament disassembly. The mechanism of Pi release in actin filaments has remained elusive for over 20 years. Here, we developed a microfluidic setup to accurately monitor the depolymerization of individual filaments and determine their local ADP-Pi content. We demonstrate that Pi release in the filament is not a vectorial but a random process with a half-time of 102 seconds, irrespective of whether the filament is assembled from actin or profilin-actin. Pi release from the depolymerizing barbed end is faster (half-time of 0.39 seconds) and further accelerated by profilin. Profilin accelerates the depolymerization of both ADP- and ADP-Pi-F-actin. Altogether, our data show that during elongation from profilin-actin, the dissociation of profilin from the growing barbed end is not coupled to Pi release or to ATP cleavage on the terminal subunit. These results emphasize the potential of microfluidics in elucidating actin regulation at the scale of individual filaments.},

	abstract = {A detailed mechanism that fully accounts for the Mg2+-induced polymerization of actin in the presence or absence of Ca2+ at 20 degrees C and pH 8 is presented. In the absence of Ca2+, the mechanism of the Mg2+-induced polymerization is as follows: Mg2+ binds to a metal-binding site on G-actin and induces a conformational change, which is required for eventual polymerization. The overall dissociation constant for this binding is about 30 microM. This actin species then binds a second molecule of Mg2+ (Kd = 5 mM), which yields a species capable of polymerization. Dimer formation from this monomeric species is quite unfavorable, but trimer formation from dimer and monomer is much more favorable. The trimer may then elongate to give filaments. Ca2+, when present, binds at the same site as the tightly bound Mg2+ and must be displaced by Mg2+ before the conformational change can occur. The rate and dissociation constants for tight binding of Ca2+ and Mg2+ and for the conformational change are consistent with those observed previously by using a fluorescently labeled G-actin. With the mechanism proposed, it is possible to fit the full time course of polymerization over a wide range of actin concentrations, Mg2+ concentrations, and Ca2+ concentrations.},

In 0.1 M KCl with 1 mM Mg2+, log/log plots of the rate of the early, slow phase of polymerization vs. actin concentration were linear with slopes from 1.0 to 1.3. Computer-assisted calculations of similar curves from theoretical models with different sizes for the nucleus showed that no simple model gave a log/log plot with a slope less than 1.5. Addition of a first-order, monomer activation step before nucleation allowed models of any reasonable nucleus size to have a slope of 1. This is the first evidence that such a step is part of the kinetic pathway for actin polymerization. In 0.1 M KCl with 0.2 mM Ca2+, log/log plots of the rate of the slow phase vs. actin concentration were linear with slopes from 2.0 to 2.5. Monomer activation was not necessary to account for this slope. However, fits of kinetic curves calculated from theoretical models to experimental kinetic curves showed that filament fragmentation was important to achieve a good fit, confirming the finding of Wegner and Savko [Wegner, A., \& Savko, P. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 1909-1913]. Our fit procedure also allowed us to estimate the size of the nucleus and the rate constants for activation, nucleation, and fragmentation.

The CD ellipticity (x 10(3) deg cm2 dmol-1) at 222 nm of nucleotide-free actin in 48\% sucrose is -3.54. The ellipticity of denatured nucleotide-free actin in dilute buffer is -2.01 and that of native actin is -4.19.

Our ability to generate stable nucleotide-free actin permitted us to study the kinetics of nucleotide binding to actin. The observed rate constant of the reaction is linearly dependent on the concentration of epsilon ATP, a fluorescent analog of ATP. The inverse of the association rate constant is proportional to the viscosity of the solvent with an intercept near the origin as expected for a diffusion-limited reaction.

VopL is an effector protein from Vibrio parahaemolyticus that nucleates actin filaments. VopL consists of a VopL C-terminal domain (VCD) and an array of three WASP homology 2 (WH2) motifs. Here, we report the crystal structure of the VCD dimer bound to actin. The VCD organizes three actin monomers in a spatial arrangement close to that found in the canonical actin filament. In this arrangement, WH2 motifs can be modeled into the binding site of each actin without steric clashes. The data suggest a mechanism of nucleation wherein VopL creates filament-like structures, organized by the VCD with monomers delivered by the WH2 array, that can template addition of new subunits. Similarities with Arp2/3 complex and formin proteins suggest that organization of monomers into filament-like structures is a general and central feature of actin nucleation.

	abstract = {Proteins containing repeats of the WASP homology 2 (WH2) actin-binding module are multifunctional regulators of actin nucleation and assembly. The bacterial effector VopF in Vibrio cholerae, like VopL in Vibrio parahaemolyticus, is a unique homodimer of three WH2 motifs linked by a C-terminal dimerization domain. We show that only the first and third WH2 domains of VopF bind G-actin in a non-nucleating, sequestered conformation. Moreover, dimeric WH2 domains in VopF give rise to unprecedented regulation of actin assembly. Specifically, two WH2 domains on opposite protomers of VopF direct filament assembly from actin or profilin–actin by binding terminal subunits and uncapping capping protein from barbed ends by a new mechanism. Thus, VopF does not nucleate filaments by capping a pointed-end F-actin hexamer. These properties may contribute to VopF pathogenicity, and they show how dimeric WH2 peptides may mediate processive filament growth.},

We show that the strong actin filament nucleation activity of Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopL depends on its three W domains and on its dimerization through a unique VopL C-terminal domain (VCD). The VCD shows a previously unknown all-helical fold and interacts with the pointed end of the actin nucleus, contributing to the nucleation activity directly and through duplication of the W domain repeat. VopL promotes rapid cycles of filament nucleation and detachment but generally has no effect on elongation. Profilin inhibits VopL-induced nucleation by competing for actin binding to the W domains. Combined, the results suggest that VopL stabilizes a hexameric double-stranded pointed end nucleus. Analysis of hybrid constructs of VopL and the eukaryotic nucleator Spire suggest that Spire may also function as a dimer in cells.},

We have previously characterized a non-O1, non-O139 Vibrio cholerae strain, AM-19226, that lacks the known virulence factors but contains components of a type III secretion system (T3SS). In this study, we demonstrated that the T3SS is functional and is required for intestinal colonization in the infant mouse model. We also identified VopF, which is conserved among T3SS-positive V. cholerae strains, as an effector containing both formin homology 1-like (FH1-like) and WASP homology 2 (WH2) domains. Translocation of VopF by V. cholerae or expression by transfection altered the actin cytoskeletal organization of the eukaryotic host cells. In vitro domain analysis indicated that both FH1-like and WH2 domains are required for actin nucleation and polymerization activity. These data correlate with in vivo data, suggesting that VopF-mediated alteration of actin polymerization homeostasis is required for efficient intestinal colonization by T3SS+ V. cholerae in the infant mouse model.},

	abstract = {The filaments of the contractile apparatus have been isolated from a wide variety of smooth and striated muscles and examined in negatively-stained preparations in the electron microscope. In all cases there are thin filaments which are indistinguishable from the filaments in F-actin preparations. The filament consists of two helically-wound strands composed of subunits which appear to be alike and approximately spherical. The arrangement of the subunits corresponds to that of the scattering centres in one of the possible structures for actin deduced by Selby \& Bear (1956) from the moderate-angle X-ray diffraction pattern of intact dried muscle. The number of globular subunits per turn of the helix (if integral) is 13 (cf. either 13 or 15 in the models proposed from diffraction data). The spacing of the subunits along each strand is 56·5 Å (cf. 55 Å in the models proposed from diffraction data). The cross-over points of the two twisted strands are spaced at intervals of 349 Å along the filament (cf. either 351 Å or 406 Å in the models proposed from diffraction data). The overall diameter of the filament is about 80 Å. It is shown in the case of rabbit skeletal muscle that this result is consistent with the quantity of actin in that muscle. There is good evidence that each of the globular subunits seen in the electron microscope represents one actin monomer. The structure of actin alone does not account for (i) the approximately 400 Å axial periodicity observed in the I-substance of fibrils in the electron microscope, or (ii) the reflection at about 400 Å observed in the axial diffraction pattern of intact muscle. It is suggested that both (i) and (ii) could be due to the combination of actin with other material, possibly tropomyosin B.},

	abstract = {Filopodia are highly dynamic finger-like cell protrusions filled with parallel bundles of actin filaments. Previously we have shown that Diaphanous-related formin dDia2 is involved in the formation of filopodia. Another key player for the formation of filopodia across many species is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). It has been proposed that the essential role of VASP for formation of filopodia is its competition with capping proteins for filament barbed-end interaction. To better understand the function of VASP in filopodium formation, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo properties of Dictyostelium VASP (DdVASP) and extended our findings to human VASP. Recombinant VASP from both species nucleated and bundled actin filaments, but did not compete with capping proteins or block depolymerization from barbed ends. Together with the finding that DdVASP binds to the FH2 domain of dDia2, these data indicate that the crucial role of VASP in filopodium formation is different from uncapping of actin filaments. To identify the activity of DdVASP required in this process, rescue experiments of DdVASP-null cells with mutant DdVASP constructs were performed. Only WT DdVASP, but not a mutant lacking the F-actin bundling activity, could rescue the ability of these cells to form WT-like filopodia. Our data suggest that DdVASP is complexed with dDia2 in filopodial tips and support formin-mediated filament elongation by bundling nascent actin filaments.},

Different cells produce different protrusions, from keratocytes dominated by lamellipodia, to growth cones combining filopodia and lamellipodia, to dendritic spines. One key challenge is to determine how the toolkit of actin regulators are coordinated to generate these diverse protrusive arrays. Here we use Drosophila leading-edge (LE) cells to explore how Diaphanous (Dia)-related formins and Ena/VASP proteins cooperate in this process. We first dissect the Dia regulatory region, revealing novel roles for the GTPase-binding and FH3 domains in cortical localization, filopodial initiation, and lengthening. Second, we provide evidence that activating Dia mobilizes Ena from storage places near the LE to act at the LE. Further, Dia and Ena coIP and can recruit one another to new locations, suggesting cooperation is key to their mechanisms of action. Third, we directly explore the functional relationship between Dia and Ena, varying their levels and activity separately in the same cell type. Surprisingly, although each is sufficient to induce filopodia, together they induce lamellipodia. Our data suggest they work together in a complex and nonadditive way, with the ratio between active Dia and Ena being one factor that modulates the balance between filopodia and lamellipodia.},

Here, we report the identification of two novel transmembranous human and murine semaphorins, (HSA)SEMA6A-1 and (MMU)Sema6A-1. These semaphorin 6 variants directly link the Ena/VASP and the semaphorin protein family, since SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is capable of a selective binding to the protein EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). EVL is the third member of the Ena/VASP family of proteins that was identified sharing the same structural features as Mena (mammalian enabled) and VASP, although its functionality seems to be different from that of the other members. Here we demonstrate that SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 is colocalized with EVL via its zyxin-like carboxyl-terminal domain that contains a modified binding motif, which further stresses the existence of functional differences between EVL and Mena/VASP. In addition these findings suggest a completely new role for transmembranous semaphorins such as SEMA6A-1/Sema6A-1 in retrograde signaling.},

Two profilin binding proteins, VASP and Mena, are the only cellular proteins known so far to bind directly to ActA. This interaction is mediated by a conserved module, the EVH1 domain. We identify E/DFPPPPXD/E, a motif repeated 4‐fold within the primary sequence of ActA, as the core of the consensus ligand for EVH1 domains. This motif is also present and functional in at least two cellular proteins, zyxin and vinculin, which are in this respect major eukaryotic analogs of ActA. The functional importance of the novel protein–protein interaction was examined in the Listeria system. Removal of EVH1 binding sites on ActA reduces bacterial motility and strongly attenuates Listeria virulence. Taken together we demonstrate that ActA–EVH1 binding is a paradigm for a novel class of eukaryotic protein–protein interactions involving a proline‐rich ligand that is clearly different from those described for SH3 and WW/WWP domains. This class of interactions appears to be of general importance for processes dependent on rapid actin remodeling.},

Here, evidence is provided that the affinities of these EVH1–peptide interactions are strongly dependent on the recognition of residues flanking the core FPPPP motifs. Determination of the VASP EVH1 domain solution structure, together with peptide library screening, measurement of individual Kds by fluorescence titration, and NMR chemical shift mapping, revealed a second affinity‐determining epitope present in all four ActA EVH1‐binding motifs. The epitope was shown to interact with a complementary hydrophobic site on the EVH1 surface and to increase strongly the affinity of ActA for EVH1 domains. We propose that this epitope, which is absent in the sequences of the native EVH1‐interaction partners zyxin and vinculin, may provide the pathogen with an advantage when competing for the recruitment of the host VASP and Mena proteins in the infected cell.},

	abstract = {Delivery of bacterial toxins to host cells is hindered by host protective barriers. This obstruction dictates a remarkable efficiency of toxins, a single copy of which may kill a host cell. Efficiency of actin-targeting toxins is further hampered by an overwhelming abundance of their target. The actin cross-linking domain (ACD) toxins of Vibrio species and related bacterial genera catalyze the formation of covalently cross-linked actin oligomers. Recently, we reported that the ACD toxicity can be amplified via a multivalent inhibitory association of actin oligomers with actin assembly factors formins, suggesting that the oligomers may act as secondary toxins. Importantly, many proteins involved in nucleation, elongation, severing, branching, and bundling of actin filaments contain G-actin-binding Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-homology motifs 2 (WH2) organized in tandem and therefore may act as a multivalent platform for high-affinity interaction with the ACD-cross-linked actin oligomers. Using live-cell single-molecule speckle (SiMS) microscopy, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and actin polymerization assays, we show that, in addition to formins, the oligomers bind with high affinity and potently inhibit several families of actin assembly factors: Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphorprotein (VASP); Spire; and the Arp2/3 complex, both in vitro and in live cells. As a result, ACD blocks the actin retrograde flow and membrane dynamics and disrupts association of Ena/VASP with adhesion complexes. This study defines ACD as a universal inhibitor of tandem-organized G-actin binding proteins that overcomes the abundance of actin by redirecting the toxicity cascade toward less abundant targets and thus leading to profound disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and disruption of actin-dependent cellular functions.},

	abstract = {Actin Crosslinking Domain (ACD) is produced by several life-threatening Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria as part of larger toxins and delivered into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells via Type I or Type VI secretion systems. Upon delivery, ACD disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by catalyzing intermolecular amide bond formation between E270 and K50 residues of actin, leading to the formation of polymerization-deficient actin oligomers. Ultimately, accumulation of the crosslinked oligomers results in structural and functional failure of the actin cytoskeleton in affected cells. In the present work, we advanced in our understanding of the ACD catalytic mechanism by discovering that the enzyme transfers the gamma-phosphoryl group of ATP to the E270 actin residue, resulting in the formation of an activated acyl phosphate intermediate. This intermediate is further hydrolyzed and the energy of hydrolysis is utilized for the formation of the amide bond between actin subunits. We also determined the pH optimum for the reaction and the kinetic parameters of ACD catalysis for its substrates, ATP and actin. ACD showed sigmoidal, non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics for actin (K(0.5) = 30 µM) reflecting involvement of two actin molecules in a single crosslinking event. We established that ACD can also utilize Mg(2+)-GTP to support crosslinking, but the kinetic parameters (K(M) = 8 µM and 50 µM for ATP and GTP, respectively) suggest that ATP is the primary substrate of ACD in vivo. The optimal pH for ACD activity was in the range of 7.0-9.0. The elucidated kinetic mechanism of ACD toxicity adds to understanding of complex network of host-pathogen interactions.},

	abstract = {The Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of a severe diarrheal disease that afflicts three to five million persons annually, causing up to 200,000 deaths. Nearly all V. cholerae strains produce a large multifunctional-autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTXVc), which contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of cholera in model systems. The actin cross-linking domain (ACD) of MARTXVc directly catalyzes a covalent cross-linking of monomeric G-actin into oligomeric chains and causes cell rounding, but the nature of the cross-linked bond and the mechanism of the actin cytoskeleton disruption remained elusive. To elucidate the mechanism of ACD action and effect on actin, we identified the covalent cross-link bond between actin protomers using limited proteolysis, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry. We report here that ACD catalyzes the formation of an intermolecular iso-peptide bond between residues E270 and K50 located in the hydrophobic and the DNaseI-binding loops of actin, respectively. Mutagenesis studies confirm that no other residues on actin can be cross-linked by ACD both in vitro and in vivo. This cross-linking locks actin protomers into an orientation different from that of F-actin, resulting in strong inhibition of actin polymerization. This report describes a microbial toxin mechanism acting via iso-peptide bond cross-linking between host proteins and is, to the best of our knowledge, the only known example of a peptide linkage between nonterminal glutamate and lysine side chains.},

	abstract = {The Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae causes diarrheal disease through the export of enterotoxins. The V. cholerae RTX toxin was previously identified and characterized by its ability to round human laryngeal epithelial (HEp-2) cells. Further investigation determined that cell rounding is caused by the depolymerization of actin stress fibers, through the unique mechanism of covalent actin cross-linking. In this study, we identify a domain within the full-length RTX toxin that is capable of mediating the cross-linking reaction when transiently expressed within eukaryotic cells. A structure/function analysis of the actin cross-linking domain (ACD) reveals that a 412-aa, or a 47.8-kDa, region is essential for cross-linking activity. When this domain is deleted from the full-length toxin gene, actin cross-linking, but not cell rounding, is eliminated, indicating that this toxin carries multiple dissociable activities. The ACD shares 59\% amino acid identity with a hypothetical protein from V. cholerae, VC1416, and transient expression of the C-terminal domain of VC1416 also results in actin cross-linking in eukaryotic cells. The presence of this second ACD linked to an Rhs-like element suggests that V. cholerae acquired the domain by horizontal gene transfer and the ACD was inserted into the RTX toxin by gene duplication through the evolution of V. cholerae.},

In Vibrio cholerae, T6SS have been found to secrete three related proteins extracellularly, VgrG-1, VgrG-2, and VgrG-3. VgrG-1 can covalently cross-link actin in vitro, and this activity was used to demonstrate that V. cholerae can translocate VgrG-1 into macrophages by a T6SS-dependent mechanism. Protein structure search algorithms predict that VgrG-related proteins likely assemble into a trimeric complex that is analogous to that formed by the two trimeric proteins gp27 and gp5 that make up the baseplate “tail spike” of Escherichia coli bacteriophage T4. VgrG-1 was shown to interact with itself, VgrG-2, and VgrG-3, suggesting that such a complex does form. Because the phage tail spike protein complex acts as a membrane-penetrating structure as well as a conduit for the passage of DNA into phage-infected cells, we propose that the VgrG components of the T6SS apparatus may assemble a “cell-puncturing device” analogous to phage tail spikes to deliver effector protein domains through membranes of target host cells.},

Using in vitro TIRF microscopy, we show for the first time that both human and Dictyostelium VASP are directly involved in accelerating filament elongation by delivering monomeric actin to the growing barbed end. In solution, DdVASP markedly accelerated actin filament elongation in a concentration‐dependent manner but was inhibited by low concentrations of capping protein (CP). In striking contrast, VASP clustered on functionalized beads switched to processive filament elongation that became insensitive even to very high concentrations of CP. Supplemented with the in vivo analysis of VASP mutants and an EM structure of the protein, we propose a mechanism by which membrane‐associated VASP oligomers use their WH2 domains to effect both the tethering of actin filaments and their processive elongation in sites of active actin assembly.},

In vitro, they enhance elongation of actin filaments, but at rates differing in nearly an order of magnitude according to species, raising questions about the molecular determinants of rate control. Chimeras from fast and slow elongating VASP proteins were generated and their ability to promote actin polymerization and to bind G‐actin was assessed. By in vitro TIRF microscopy as well as thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, we show that the velocity of VASP‐mediated filament elongation depends on G‐actin recruitment by the WASP homology 2 motif. Comparison of the experimentally observed elongation rates with a quantitative mathematical model moreover revealed that Ena/VASP‐mediated filament elongation displays a saturation dependence on the actin monomer concentration, implying that Ena/VASP proteins, independent of species, are fully saturated with actin in vivo and generally act as potent filament elongators. Moreover, our data showed that spontaneous addition of monomers does not occur during processive VASP‐mediated filament elongation on surfaces, suggesting that most filament formation in cells is actively controlled.},

	abstract = {Cross-linking of actin filaments (F-actin) into bundles and networks was investigated with three different isoforms of the dumbbell-shaped alpha-actinin homodimer under identical reaction conditions. These were isolated from chicken gizzard smooth muscle, Acanthamoeba, and Dictyostelium, respectively. Examination in the electron microscope revealed that each isoform was able to cross-link F-actin into networks. In addition, F-actin bundles were obtained with chicken gizzard and Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin, but not Dictyostelium alpha-actinin under conditions where actin by itself polymerized into disperse filaments. This F-actin bundle formation critically depended on the proper molar ratio of alpha-actinin to actin, and hence F-actin bundles immediately disappeared when free alpha-actinin was withdrawn from the surrounding medium. The apparent dissociation constants (Kds) at half-saturation of the actin binding sites were 0.4 microM at 22 degrees C and 1.2 microM at 37 degrees C for chicken gizzard, and 2.7 microM at 22 degrees C for both Acanthamoeba and Dictyostelium alpha-actinin. Chicken gizzard and Dictyostelium alpha-actinin predominantly cross-linked actin filaments in an antiparallel fashion, whereas Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin cross-linked actin filaments preferentially in a parallel fashion. The average molecular length of free alpha-actinin was 37 nm for glycerol-sprayed/rotary metal-shadowed and 35 nm for negatively stained chicken gizzard; 46 and 44 nm, respectively, for Acanthamoeba; and 34 and 31 nm, respectively, for Dictyostelium alpha-actinin. In negatively stained preparations we also evaluated the average molecular length of alpha-actinin when bound to actin filaments: 36 nm for chicken gizzard and 35 nm for Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin, a molecular length roughly coinciding with the crossover repeat of the two-stranded F-actin helix (i.e., 36 nm), but only 28 nm for Dictyostelium alpha-actinin. Furthermore, the minimal spacing between cross-linking alpha-actinin molecules along actin filaments was close to 36 nm for both smooth muscle and Acanthamoeba alpha-actinin, but only 31 nm for Dictyostelium alpha-actinin. This observation suggests that the molecular length of the alpha-actinin homodimer may determine its spacing along the actin filament, and hence F-actin bundle formation may require "tight" (i.e., one molecule after the other) and "untwisted" (i.e., the long axis of the molecule being parallel to the actin filament axis) packing of alpha-actinin molecules along the actin filaments.},

Recently, singed protein was shown to have 35\% peptide identity with echinoderm fascin. Fascin is found in actin filament bundles in microvilli of sea urchin eggs and in filopodial extensions in coelomocytes. We show that Drosophila singed is required for actin filament bundle formation in the cytoplasm of nurse cells during oogenesis; in severe mutants, the absence of cytoplasmic actin filament bundles allows nurse cell nuclei to lodge in ring canals and block nurse cell cytoplasm transport. Singed is also required for organized actin filament bundle formation in the cellular extension that forms a bristle; in severe mutants, the small disorganized actin filament bundles lack structural integrity and allow bristles to bend and branch during extension. Singed protein is also expressed in migratory cells of the developing egg chamber and in the socket cell of the developing bristle, but no defect is observed in these cells in singed mutants. Purified, bacterially expressed singed protein bundles actin filaments in vitro with the same stoichiometry reported for purified sea urchin fascin. Singed-saturated actin bundles have a molar ratio of singed/actin of approximately 1:4.3 and a transverse cross-banding pattern of 12 nm seen using electron microscopy. Our results suggest that singed protein is required for actin filament bundle formation and is a Drosophila homolog of echinoderm fascin.},

In addition to the classical methods of differential protein gel or blot staining by dyes and fluorophores, mass-spectrometry-based quantification methods have gained increasing popularity over the past five years. Most of these methods employ differential stable isotope labeling to create a specific mass tag that can be recognized by a mass spectrometer and at the same time provide the basis for quantification. These mass tags can be introduced into proteins or peptides (i) metabolically, (ii) by chemical means, (iii) enzymatically, or (iv) provided by spiked synthetic peptide standards. In contrast, label-free quantification approaches aim to correlate the mass spectrometric signal of intact proteolytic peptides or the number of peptide sequencing events with the relative or absolute protein quantity directly.

To understand how Delphilin functions in neurons, we studied the actin assembly properties of this formin. Formins have a conserved formin homology 2 domain, which nucleates and associates with the fast-growing end of actin filaments, influencing filament growth together with the formin homology 1 (FH1) domain. The strength of nucleation and elongation varies widely across formins. Additionally, most formins have conserved domains that regulate actin assembly through an intramolecular interaction. Delphilin is distinct from other formins in several ways: its expression is limited to Purkinje cells, it lacks classical autoinhibitory domains, and its FH1 domain has minimal proline-rich sequence. We found that Delphilin is an actin nucleator that does not accelerate elongation, although it binds to the barbed end of filaments. In addition, Delphilin exhibits a preference for actin isoforms, nucleating nonmuscle actin but not muscle actin, which has not been described or systematically studied in other formins. Finally, Delphilin is the first formin studied that is not regulated by intramolecular interactions. We speculate how the activity we observe is consistent with its localization in the small dendritic spines.},

Focal adhesions (FAs) and stress fibers (SFs) act in concert during cell motility and in response to the extracellular environment. Although the structures of mature FAs and SFs are well studied, less is known about how they assemble and mature de novo during initial cell spreading. In this study using live-cell Airyscan microscopy, we find that FAs undergo “splitting” during their assembly, in which the FA divides along its longitudinal axis. Before splitting, FAs initially appear as assemblies of multiple linear units (FAUs) of 0.3-μm width. Splitting occurs between FAUs, resulting in mature FAs of either a single FAU or of a small number of FAUs that remain attached at their distal tips. Variations in splitting occur based on cell type and extracellular matrix. Depletion of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) results in reduced splitting. FA-associated tension increases progressively during splitting. Early in cell spreading, ventral SFs are detected first, with other SF sub-types (transverse arcs and dorsal SFs) being detected later. Our findings suggest that the fundamental unit of FAs is the fixed-width FAU, and that dynamic interactions between FAUs control adhesion morphology.},

It is known that actin filaments are bundled hexagonally and provide rigidity to filopodia by virtue of fascin, which plays a central role in actin filament bundling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remain unclear. Here, we observed the filopodia of intact whole cells fixed by rapid freezing and revealed their three-dimensional structure by cryo-electron tomography and image processing; the actin filament bundling structure by fascin was clarified at high resolution under physiological conditions. It was found that actin filaments in vivo were more numerous than in bundles reconstructed in vitro, and each filopodial actin filament had limited variability in helical twisting. In addition, statistical analysis of actin filament bundles unveiled their detailed architecture. In filopodia, actin filaments had highly ordered structures, and the shift between cross-links of each adjacent actin filament was approximately 2.7 nm, similar to the monomer repeat of actin filaments. We then proposed a plausible actin-fascin cross-link model at the amino acid level and identified three fascin binding sites on two adjacent actin filaments: one filament bound fascin at two discrete, widely separated regions and the other bound fascin in a single small region. We propose that these two different binding modalities should confer rigid bundles that retain flexibility and dynamic performance. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Summary
Actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilins contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics by promoting rapid actin filament disassembly. In the classical view, ADF/cofilin sever filaments, and capping proteins block filament barbed ends whereas pointed ends depolymerize, at a rate that is still debated. Here, by monitoring the activity of the three mammalian ADF/cofilin isoforms on individual skeletal muscle and cytoplasmic actin filaments, we directly quantify the reactions underpinning filament severing and depolymerization from both ends. We find that, in the absence of monomeric actin, soluble ADF/cofilin can associate with bare filament barbed ends to accelerate their depolymerization. Compared to bare filaments, ADF/cofilin-saturated filaments depolymerize faster from their pointed ends and slower from their barbed ends, resulting in similar depolymerization rates at both ends. This effect is isoform specific because depolymerization is faster for ADF- than for cofilin-saturated filaments. We also show that, unexpectedly, ADF/cofilin-saturated filaments qualitatively differ from bare filaments: their barbed ends are very difficult to cap or elongate, and consequently undergo depolymerization even in the presence of capping protein and actin monomers. Such depolymerizing ADF/cofilin-decorated barbed ends are produced during 17\% of severing events. They are also the dominant fate of filament barbed ends in the presence of capping protein, because capping allows growing ADF/cofilin domains to reach the barbed ends, thereby promoting their uncapping and subsequent depolymerization. Our experiments thus reveal how ADF/cofilin, together with capping protein, control the dynamics of actin filament barbed and pointed ends. Strikingly, our results propose that significant barbed-end depolymerization may take place in cells.},

	abstract = {Through the coordinated action of diverse actin-binding proteins, cells simultaneously assemble actin filaments with distinct architectures and dynamics to drive different processes. Actin filament cross-linking proteins organize filaments into higher order networks, although the requirement of cross-linking activity in cells has largely been assumed rather than directly tested. Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe assembles actin into three discrete structures: endocytic actin patches, polarizing actin cables, and the cytokinetic contractile ring. The fission yeast filament cross-linker fimbrin Fim1 primarily localizes to Arp2/3 complex-nucleated branched filaments of the actin patch and by a lesser amount to bundles of linear antiparallel filaments in the contractile ring. It is unclear whether Fim1 associates with bundles of parallel filaments in actin cables. We previously discovered that a principal role of Fim1 is to control localization of tropomyosin Cdc8, thereby facilitating cofilin-mediated filament turnover. Therefore, we hypothesized that the bundling ability of Fim1 is dispensable for actin patches but is important for the contractile ring and possibly actin cables. By directly visualizing actin filament assembly using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we determined that Fim1 bundles filaments in both parallel and antiparallel orientations and efficiently bundles Arp2/3 complex-branched filaments in the absence but not the presence of actin capping protein. Examination of cells exclusively expressing a truncated version of Fim1 that can bind but not bundle actin filaments revealed that bundling activity of Fim1 is in fact important for all three actin structures. Therefore, fimbrin Fim1 has diverse roles as both a filament “gatekeeper” and as a filament cross-linker.},

In this study, we reconstruct the origin of metazoan filopodia and microvilli. We first report on the evolutionary assembly of the filopodial molecular toolkit and show that homologs of many metazoan filopodial components, including fascin and myosin X, were already present in the unicellular or colonial progenitors of metazoans. Furthermore, we find that the actin crosslinking protein fascin localizes to filopodia-like structures and microvilli in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. In addition, homologs of filopodial genes in the holozoan Capsaspora owczarzaki are upregulated in filopodia-bearing cells relative to those that lack them. Therefore, our findings suggest that proteins essential for metazoan filopodia and microvilli are functionally conserved in unicellular and colonial holozoans and that the last common ancestor of metazoans bore a complex and specific filopodial machinery.},

In decorated filaments, the base of alpha A1-2 is centered about the outer face of subdomain 2 of actin and contacts subdomain 1 of two neighboring monomers along the long-pitch (two-start) helical strands. Using the atomic model of F-actin (Lorenz, M., D. Popp, and K. C. Holmes. 1993. J. Mol.

Using an in vitro bead motility assay, we show that WAVE directly binds VASP, resulting in an increase in Arp2/3 complex–based actin assembly. We show that this interaction is important in vivo as well, for the formation of lamellipodia during the ventral enclosure event of Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis. Ena/VASP's ability to bind F-actin and profilin-complexed G-actin are important for its effect, whereas Ena/VASP tetramerization is not necessary. Our data are consistent with the idea that binding of Ena/VASP to WAVE potentiates Arp2/3 complex activity and lamellipodial actin assembly.},

The manner in which CH-domains bind F-actin has been controversial. Using cryo-EM and a single-particle approach to helical reconstruction, we have generated 12-Å-resolution maps of F-actin alone and F-actin decorated with a fragment of human fimbrin (L-plastin) containing tandem CH-domains. The high resolution allows an unambiguous fit of the crystal structure of fimbrin into the map. The interaction between fimbrin ABD2 (actin binding domain 2) and F-actin is different from any interaction previously observed or proposed for tandem CH-domain proteins, showing that the structural conservation of the CH-domains does not lead to a conserved mode of interaction with F-actin. Both the stapling of adjacent actin protomers and the additional closure of the nucleotide binding cleft in F-actin when the fimbrin fragment binds may explain how fimbrin can stabilize actin filaments. A mechanism is proposed where ABD1 of fimbrin becomes activated for binding a second actin filament after ABD2 is bound to a first filament, and this can explain how mutations of residues buried in the interface between ABD2 and ABD1 can rescue temperature-sensitive defects in actin.},

Our mutant analysis shows that eliminating UNC-34 function results in neuronal migration and polarity phenotypes that are enhanced at higher temperatures, revealing a heat-sensitive process that is normally masked by the presence of UNC-34. Finally, we show that the UNC-34 protein is expressed broadly and accumulates in axons and at the apical junctions of epithelial cells. While most mutants lacked detectable UNC-34, three unc-34 mutants that contained missense mutations in the EVH1 domain produced full-length UNC-34 that failed to localize to apical junctions and axons, supporting the role for the EVH1 domain in localizing Ena/VASP family members.},

We study the linker-dependent thermodynamic transition of bundled actin filaments from their native state to the overtwisted state and map out the "twist-state" phase diagram in terms of the availability as well as the flexibility of crosslinker proteins. We predict that the transition from the uncrosslinked to fully crosslinked state is highly sensitive to linker flexibility: flexible crosslinking smoothly distorts the twist state of bundled filaments, while rigidly crosslinked bundles undergo a phase transition, rapidly overtwisting filaments over a narrow range of free crosslinker concentrations. Additionally, we predict a rich spectrum of intermediate structures, composed of alternating domains of sparsely bound (untwisted) and strongly bound (overtwisted) filaments. This model reveals that subtle differences in crosslinking agents themselves modify not only the detailed structure of parallel actin bundles, but also the thermodynamic pathway by which they form.},

In this work we show that this variability was unchanged when different methods were used to prepare filaments for electron microscopy. We also show that actin-binding proteins can modulate the variability in twist. Three preparations of actin filaments were photographed in the electron microscope: negatively stained filaments, replicas of rapidly frozen, etched filaments, and frozen hydrated filaments. In addition, micrographs of actin + tropomyosin + troponin (thin filaments), of actin + myosin S1 (decorated filaments), and of filaments frayed from the acrosomal process of Limulus sperm (Limulus filaments) were obtained. We used two independent methods to measure variable twist based on Fourier transforms of single filaments. The first involved measuring layer line intensity versus filament length and the second involved measuring layer line position. We measured a variability in the intersubunit angle of actin filaments of approximately 12 degrees independent of the method of preparation or of measurement. Thin filaments have 15 degrees of variability, but the increase over pure actin is not statistically significant. Decorated filaments and Limulus filaments, however, have significantly less variability (approximately 2 and 1 degree, respectively), indicating a torsional stiffening relative to actin. The results from actin alone using different preparative methods are evidence that variable twist is a property of actin in solution. The results from actin filaments in the presence of actin-binding proteins suggest that the angular variability can be modulated, depending on the biological function.},

In a sedimentation assay, fimbrin bound to F-actin in a salt-dependent manner, with binding being optimal in 30 mM KCl and inhibited in greater than 100 mM KCl. In 50 mM KCl, which allows efficient polymerization of actin, the interaction was stabilized by the presence of polyethylene glycol. Under these conditions, binding was unaffected by the inclusion of up to 5 mM Ca2+ but was inhibited by greater than 0.5 mM Mg2+. Electron microscopy revealed that fimbrin crosslinked F-actin into relatively straight bundles with shorter bundles being formed at high fimbrin-to-actin ratios. The results suggest that fimbrin crosslinks F-actin in such a way as to confer some rigidity on the bundle formed.

Furthermore, Cdc8, Fim1, and Adf1 all compete for association with F-actin by different mechanisms, and their cooperative association with actin filaments affects their ability to compete. Finally, competition between Fim1 and Adf1 for F-actin synergizes their activities, promoting rapid displacement of Cdc8 from a dense F-actin network. Our findings reveal that competitive and cooperative interactions between actin binding proteins help define their associations with different F-actin networks.},

Many EVH1?containing proteins are associated closely with actin?based structures and are involved in re?organization of the actin cytoskeleton. EVH1 domains are also present in proteins enriched in neuronal tissue, thus implicating them as potential mediators of synaptic plasticity, linking them to memory formation and learning. Like Src homology 3, WW and GYF domains and profilin, EVH1 domains recognize and bind specific proline?rich sequences (PRSs). The binding is of low affinity, but tightly regulated by the high specificity encoded into residues in the protein:peptide interface. In general, a small (3?6 residue) ?core? PRS in the target protein binds a ?recognition pocket? on the domain surface. Further affinity? and specificity?increasing interactions are then formed between additional domain epitopes and peptide ?core?flanking? residues. The three?dimensional structures of EVH1:peptide complexes now reveal, in great detail, some of the most important features of these interactions and allow us to better understand the origins of specificity, ligand orientation and sequence degeneracy of target peptides, in low affinity signalling complexes.},

We have found that human fascin is phosphorylated in vivo upon treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a tumor promoter. The in vivo phosphorylation is gradually increased from 0.13 to 0.30 mol/mol during 2 h of treatment, concomitant with the disappearance of human fascin from stress fibers, membrane ruffles, and microspikes. Human fascin can also be phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C at the same sites as observed in vivo as judged by phosphopeptide mapping. The extent of phosphorylation depends on pH: the stoichiometries are 0.05, 0.38, and 0.6 mol of phosphate/mol of protein at pH 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0, respectively. Phosphorylation greatly reduces actin binding of human fascin, while lowering the pH to 6.0 alone does not affect fascin-actin binding. With the incorporation of 0.25 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, the actin binding affinity is reduced from 6.7 × 10 to 1.5 × 10M. The actin bundling activity is also decreased. These results suggest that phosphorylation of fascin plays a role in actin reorganization after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate.},

Analysis of cellular localization of known actin cross-linking proteins in mouse melanoma B16F1 cells revealed that fascin was specifically localized along the entire length of all filopodia, whereas other actin cross-linkers were not. RNA interference of fascin reduced the number of filopodia, and remaining filopodia had abnormal morphology with wavy and loosely bundled actin organization. Dephosphorylation of serine 39 likely determined cellular filopodia frequency. The constitutively active fascin mutant S39A increased the number and length of filopodia, whereas the inactive fascin mutant S39E reduced filopodia frequency. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of GFP-tagged wild-type and S39A fascin showed that dephosphorylated fascin underwent rapid cycles of association to and dissociation from actin filaments in filopodia, with t1/2 {\textless} 10 s. We propose that fascin is a key specific actin cross-linker, providing stiffness for filopodial bundles, and that its dynamic behavior allows for efficient coordination between elongation and bundling of filopodial actin filaments.},

Small-molecule fascin inhibitors block tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Here we present the structural basis for the mechanism of action of these small-molecule fascin inhibitors. X-ray crystal structural analysis of a complex of fascin and a fascin inhibitor shows that binding of the fascin inhibitor to the hydrophobic cleft between the domains 1 and 2 of fascin induces a {\textasciitilde}35o rotation of domain 1, leading to the distortion of both the actin-binding sites 1 and 2 on fascin.

	abstract = {Formins drive actin filament assembly for diverse cellular processes including motility, establishing polarity, and cell division. To investigate the mechanism of contractile ring assembly in animal cells, we directly compared the actin assembly properties of formins required for cytokinesis in the nematode worm early embryo (CYK-1) and fission yeast (Cdc12p). Like Cdc12p and most other formins, CYK-1 nucleates actin filament assembly and remains processively associated with the elongating barbed end while facilitating the addition of profilin-actin above the theoretical diffusion-limited rate. However, specific properties differ significantly between Cdc12p and CYK-1. Cdc12p efficiently nucleates filaments that in the presence of profilin elongate at approximately the same rate as control filaments without formin (approximately 10.0 subunits/s). CYK-1 is an inefficient nucleator but allows filaments to elongate profilin-actin 6-fold faster than Cdc12p (approximately 60 subunits/s). Both Cdc12p and CYK-1 bind to pre-assembled actin filaments with low nanomolar affinity, but CYK-1 dissociates 2 orders of magnitude more quickly. However, CYK-1 rapidly re-associates with free barbed ends. Cdc12p allows barbed ends to elongate in the presence of excess capping protein, whereas capping protein inhibits CYK-1-mediated actin assembly. Therefore, these evolutionarily diverse formins can drive contractile ring assembly by a generally similar mechanism, but cells with unique dimensions and physical parameters might require proteins with carefully tuned actin assembly properties.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tropomyosin is an important actin filament-stabilizing protein that controls the access of other essential proteins to filaments, including myosin motors, Arp2/3 complex, formin, and cofilin. It is therefore critical to establish mechanisms for regulating the actin filament binding of tropomyosin. We examined how the actin filament crosslinking protein fimbrin Fim1p and tropomyosin Cdc8p affect each other's ability to bind filaments, localize to particular cellular structures, and regulate filament severing by cofilin Adf1p in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
RESULTS: We discovered a novel mechanism for regulating actin filament dynamics in fission yeast. Fim1p inhibits Cdc8p binding to actin filaments in vitro, which permits Adf1p-mediated severing in the presence of Cdc8p. In cells, the balance between Fim1p and Cdc8p is important for both endocytic actin patch kinetics and contractile ring assembly during cytokinesis. High Fim1p concentrations prevent Cdc8p from associating with actin patches, allowing rapid patch turnover and motility. In the absence of Fim1p, ectopic localization of Cdc8p to actin patches increases patch lifetime while decreasing patch motility. Fim1p and Cdc8p also play antagonistic roles during cytokinesis, in which the deletion of Fim1p rescues the contractile ring assembly defects caused by mutation of Cdc8p.
CONCLUSION: Fimbrin Fim1p dissociates tropomyosin Cdc8p from actin filaments, permitting cofilin Adf1p-mediated severing. Therefore, we propose that in addition to actin filament crosslinking, Fim1p has a novel role as a positive actin-binding "selector" protein that promotes the access of other proteins to actin filaments by inhibiting Cdc8p.},

Investigation of a mutant with higher bundling activity, SpAin1(216E), revealed that dynamic SpAin1-mediated bundling is crucial for proper ring assembly and constriction., The actomyosin contractile ring is a network of cross-linked actin filaments that facilitates cytokinesis in dividing cells. Contractile ring formation has been well characterized in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which the cross-linking protein α-actinin SpAin1 bundles the actin filament network. However, the specific biochemical properties of SpAin1 and whether they are tailored for cytokinesis are not known. Therefore we purified SpAin1 and quantified its ability to dynamically bind and bundle actin filaments in vitro using a combination of bulk sedimentation assays and direct visualization by two-color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We found that, while SpAin1 bundles actin filaments of mixed polarity like other α-actinins, SpAin1 has lower bundling activity and is more dynamic than human α-actinin HsACTN4. To determine whether dynamic bundling is important for cytokinesis in fission yeast, we created the less dynamic bundling mutant SpAin1(R216E). We found that dynamic bundling is critical for cytokinesis, as cells expressing SpAin1(R216E) display disorganized ring material and delays in both ring formation and constriction. Furthermore, computer simulations of initial actin filament elongation and alignment revealed that an intermediate level of cross-linking best facilitates filament alignment. Together our results demonstrate that dynamic bundling by SpAin1 is important for proper contractile ring formation and constriction.},

Beads coated with actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3)–activating proteins can induce two distinct types of actin organization in cytoplasmic extracts: (1) comet tails or clouds displaying a dendritic array of actin filaments and (2) stars with filament bundles radiating from the bead. Actin filaments in these bundles, like those in filopodia, are long, unbranched, aligned, uniformly polar, and grow at the barbed end. Like filopodia, star bundles are enriched in fascin and lack Arp2/3 complex and capping protein. Transition from dendritic to bundled organization was induced by depletion of capping protein, and add-back of this protein restored the dendritic mode. Depletion experiments demonstrated that star formation is dependent on Arp2/3 complex. This poses the paradox of how Arp2/3 complex can be involved in the formation of both branched (lamellipodia-like) and unbranched (filopodia-like) actin structures. Using purified proteins, we showed that a small number of components are sufficient for the assembly of filopodia-like bundles: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)–coated beads, actin, Arp2/3 complex, and fascin. We propose a model for filopodial formation in which actin filaments of a preexisting dendritic network are elongated by inhibition of capping and subsequently cross-linked into bundles by fascin.},

	abstract = {Cell biologists increasingly rely on computer-aided image analysis, allowing them to collect precise, unbiased quantitative results. However, despite great progress in image processing and computer vision, current computational approaches fail to address many key aspects of cell behavior, including the cell protrusions that guide cell migration and drive morphogenesis. We developed the open source MATLAB application CellGeo, a user-friendly computational platform to allow simultaneous, automated tracking and analysis of dynamic changes in cell shape, including protrusions ranging from filopodia to lamellipodia. Our method maps an arbitrary cell shape onto a tree graph that, unlike traditional skeletonization algorithms, preserves complex boundary features. CellGeo allows rigorous but flexible definition and accurate automated detection and tracking of geometric features of interest. We demonstrate CellGeo’s utility by deriving new insights into (a) the roles of Diaphanous, Enabled, and Capping protein in regulating filopodia and lamellipodia dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster cells and (b) the dynamic properties of growth cones in catecholaminergic a–differentiated neuroblastoma cells.},

	abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0 ≤ t$_{\textrm{1}}$' ≤ t$_{\textrm{2}}$' ≤ ⋯ ≤ t$_{\textrm{N}}$'. Then {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}hat\{P\}(t) = {\textbackslash}prod\_r {\textbackslash}lbrack(N - r)/(N - r + 1){\textbackslash}rbrack\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, where r assumes those values for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' ≤ t and for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors.},

It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3’s functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3’s current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement—a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

When sets of buried residues were altered, two-, three-, and four-helix structures were formed. The x-ray crystal structure of the tetramer revealed a parallel, four-stranded coiled coil. In the tetramer conformation, the local packing geometry of the two hydrophobic positions in the heptad repeat is reversed relative to that in the dimer. These studies demonstrate that conserved, buried residues in the GCN4 leucine zipper direct dimer formation. In contrast to proposals that the pattern of hydrophobic and polar amino acids in a protein sequence is sufficient to determine three-dimensional structure, the shapes of buried side chains in coiled coils are essential determinants of the global fold.},

A class of such proteins is used by viruses as adhesins, and recent studies revealed novel β-structured motifs for them. We have been studying the folding and assembly of adenovirus fibers that consist of a globular C-terminal domain, a central fibrous shaft, and an N-terminal part that attaches to the viral capsid. The globular C-terminal, or “head” domain, has been postulated to be necessary for the trimerization of the fiber and might act as a registration signal that directs its correct folding and assembly. In this work, we replaced the head of the fiber by the trimerization domain of the bacteriophage T4 fibritin, termed “foldon.” Two chimeric proteins, comprising the foldon domain connected at the C-terminal end of four fiber shaft repeats with or without the use of a natural linker sequence, fold into highly stable, SDS-resistant trimers. The structural signatures of the chimeric proteins as seen by CD and infrared spectroscopy are reported. The results suggest that the foldon domain can successfully replace the fiber head domain in ensuring correct trimerization of the shaft sequences. Biological implications and implications for engineering highly stable, β-structured nanorods are discussed.},

	abstract = {The foldon domain constitutes the C-terminal 30 amino acid residues of the trimeric protein fibritin from bacteriophage T4. Its function is to promote folding and trimerization of fibritin. We investigated structure, stability and folding mechanism of the isolated foldon domain. The domain folds into the same trimeric β-propeller structure as in fibritin and undergoes a two-state unfolding transition from folded trimer to unfolded monomers. The folding kinetics involve several consecutive reactions. Structure formation in the region of the single β-hairpin of each monomer occurs on the submillisecond timescale. This reaction is followed by two consecutive association steps with rate constants of 1.9(±0.5)×106M−1s−1 and 5.4(±0.3)×106M−1s−1 at 0.58 M GdmCl, respectively. This is similar to the fastest reported bimolecular association reactions for folding of dimeric proteins. At low concentrations of protein, folding shows apparent third-order kinetics. At high concentrations of protein, the reaction becomes almost independent of protein concentrations with a half-time of about 3 ms, indicating that a first-order folding step from a partially folded trimer to the native protein (k=210(±20)s−1) becomes rate-limiting. Our results suggest that all steps on the folding/trimerization pathway of the foldon domain are evolutionarily optimized for rapid and specific initiation of trimer formation during fibritin assembly. The results further show that β-hairpins allow efficient and rapid protein–protein interactions during folding.},

We use modeling to examine mechanics and spatial-temporal dynamics of filopodia. We find that {\textgreater}10 actin filaments have to be bundled to overcome the membrane resistance and that the filopodial length is limited by buckling for 10–30 filaments and by G-actin diffusion for {\textgreater}30 filaments. There is an optimal number of bundled filaments, ∼30, at which the filopodial length can reach a few microns. The model explains characteristic interfilopodial distance of a few microns as a balance of initiation, lateral drift, and merging of the filopodia. The theory suggests that F-actin barbed ends have to be focused and protected from capping (the capping rate has to decrease one order of magnitude) once every hundred seconds per micron of the leading edge to initiate the observed number of filopodia. The model generates testable predictions about how filopodial length, rate of growth, and interfilopodial distance should depend on the number of bundled filaments, membrane resistance, lamellipodial protrusion rate, and G-actin diffusion coefficient.},

Based on previous analyses of fast and slow elongating VASP proteins by in vitro total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and kinetic and thermodynamic measurements, we established a kinetic model of Ena/VASP-mediated actin filament elongation. At steady state, it entails that tetrameric VASP uses one of its arms to processively track growing filament barbed ends while three G-actin–binding sites (GABs) on other arms are available to recruit and deliver monomers to the filament tip, suggesting that VASP operates as a single tetramer in solution or when clustered on a surface, albeit processivity and resistance toward capping protein (CP) differ dramatically between both conditions. Here, we tested the model by variation of the oligomerization state and by increase of the number of GABs on individual polypeptide chains. In excellent agreement with model predictions, we show that in solution the rates of filament elongation directly correlate with the number of free GABs. Strikingly, however, irrespective of the oligomerization state or presence of additional GABs, filament elongation on a surface invariably proceeded with the same rate as with the VASP tetramer, demonstrating that adjacent VASP molecules synergize in the elongation of a single filament. Additionally, we reveal that actin ATP hydrolysis is not required for VASP-mediated filament assembly. Finally, we show evidence for the requirement of VASP to form tetramers and provide an amended model of processive VASP-mediated actin assembly in clustered arrays.},

The bacterial protein ActA binds VASP via a proline-rich motif that is very similar to a sequence in the proline-rich region of the focal-adhesion protein vinculin. We have examined the ability of VASP, synthesized using an in vitro transcription/translation system, to bind to a series of vinculin peptides expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, and have shown that it binds specifically to the proline-rich region in vinculin. Using immobilized peptides corresponding to the two proline-rich motifs within this domain, the VASP-binding site was localized to proline-rich motif-l (residues 839-850). Binding to this motif was not affected by the phosphorylation state of VASP. The C-terminal region of VASP, which is known to be important in targeting VASP to focal adhesions, was shown to be required for binding. These results identify vinculin as a VASP-binding protein likely to be important in recruiting VASP to focal adhesions and the cell membrane.},

We now report that fluorescence titration showed that GP5GP5GP5 peptide binds to profilin (KD of 84 μM), and the peptide weakly inhibits exchange of actin-bound nucleotide in the absence or presence of profilin. Microinjection of synthetic GPPPPP triplet into Listeria-infected PtK2 cells promptly arrested motility at an intracellular concentration of 10 μM. This inhibition was completely neutralized when equimolar concentrations of profilin and GP5GP5GP5 were simultaneously microinjected. Fluorescence studies with [His-133-Ser]-profilin, a site-directed mutant previously shown to be defective in binding poly-l-proline [Bjorkegren, C., Rozycki, M., Schutt, C. E., Lindberg, U., \& Karlsson, R. (1993) FEBS Lett. 333, 123−126], exhibits little or no evidence of saturable GP5GP5GP5 binding. When an equimolar concentration of this [His-133-Ser]-profilin mutant was co-injected with GP5GP5GP5, the peptide's inhibitory action remained completely unaffected, indicating that GP5GP5GP5 binding to wild-type profilin represents a key step in actin-based pathogen motility. We also present a model that shows how the focal binding of VASP with its GPPPPP registers can greatly increase the local concentration of profilin and/or profilin−actin−ATP complex at the bacteria/rocket-tail interface.},

Formin homology proteins (formins) play an essential role in the formation of actin stress fibers and yeast actin cables, to which the major actin depolymerizing factor cofilin barely associates. In vitro, F-actin decorated with cofilin exhibits a marked increase in the filament twist. On the other hand, a mammalian formin mDia1 rotates along the long-pitch actin helix during processive actin elongation (helical rotation). Helical rotation may impose torsional force on F-actin in the opposite direction of the cofilin-induced twisting. Here, we show that helical rotation of mDia1 converts F-actin resistant to cofilin both in vivo and in vitro. F-actin assembled by mDia1 without rotational freedom became more resistant to the severing and binding activities of cofilin than freely rotatable F-actin. Electron micrographic analysis revealed untwisting of the long-pitch helix of F-actin elongating from mDia1 on tethering of both mDia1 and the pointed end side of the filament. In cells, single molecules of mDia1ΔC63, an activated mutant containing N-terminal regulatory domains, showed tethering to cell structures more frequently than autoinhibited wild-type mDia1 and mDia1 devoid of N-terminal domains. Overexpression of mDia1ΔC63 induced the formation of F-actin, which has prolonged lifetime and accelerates dissociation of cofilin. Helical rotation of formins may thus serve as an F-actin stabilizing mechanism by which a barbed end-bound molecule can enhance the stability of a filament over a long range.},

CRMP-1 and EVL bind to one another and together accelerate actin filament barbed-end elongation. CRMP-1 also stimulates actin assembly in the presence of VASP and Mena in vitro, but CRMP-1-dependent actin assembly in MDCK cells is EVL specific. Our results identify CRMP-1 as a novel regulator of actin filament elongation and reveal a surprisingly important role for CRMP-1, EVL, and actin polymerization in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial sheets.},

some bleaching steps might be unobserved, the ensemble of steps will be

unique and optimal estimate of the relevant parameters cannot be extracted from

In this study, we unveil the mechanism whereby actin cytoskeleton is regulated to form memory by exploring the roles of the major actin-regulatory proteins Arp2/3, VASP, and formins in long-term memory formation. Inhibition of Arp2/3, involved in actin filament branching and neuronal morphogenesis, in lateral amygdala (LA) with the specific inhibitor CK-666 during fear conditioning impaired long-term, but not short-term, fear memory. The inactive isomer CK-689 had no effect on memory formation. We observed that Arp2/3 is colocalized with the actin-regulatory protein profilin in LA neurons of fear-conditioned rats. VASP binding to profilin is needed for profilin-mediated stabilization of actin cytoskeleton and dendritic spine morphology. Microinjection of poly-proline peptide [G(GP5)3] into LA, to interfere with VASP binding to profilin, impaired long-term but not short-term fear memory formation. Control peptide [G(GA5)3] had no effect. Inhibiting formins, which regulate linear actin elongation, in LA during fear conditioning by microinjecting the formin-specific inhibitor SMIFH2 into LA had no effect on long-term fear memory formation. We conclude that Arp2/3 and VASP, through the profilin binding site, are essential for the formation of long-term fear memory in LA and propose a model whereby these proteins subserve cellular events, leading to memory consolidation.},

The force of actin bundles is essential for their protrusive activity. The bundling protein fascin is known to play a role in both invadopodia and filopodia. As it is more and more acknowledged that functionally related proteins cooperate, it is unlikely that only fascin bundles actin in these protrusions. Another interesting candidate is L-plastin, normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, but considered a common marker of many cancer types. We identified L-plastin as a new component of invadopodia, where it contributes to degradation and invasiveness. By means of specific, high-affinity nanobodies inhibiting bundling of fascin or L-plastin, we further unraveled their cooperative mode of action. We show that the bundlers cannot compensate for each other due to strikingly different bundling characteristics: L-plastin bundles are much thinner and less tightly packed. Composite bundles adopt an intermediate phenotype, with fascin delivering the rigidity and strength for protrusive force and structural stability, whereas L-plastin accounts for the flexibility needed for elongation. Consistent with this, elevated L-plastin expression promotes elongation and reduces protrusion density in cells with relatively lower L-plastin than fascin levels.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate the efficacy of double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) of gene expression in generating “knock-out” phenotypes for specific proteins in several Drosophila cell lines. We prove the applicability of this technique for studying signaling cascades by dissecting the well-characterized insulin signal transduction pathway. Specifically, we demonstrate that inhibiting the expression of the DSOR1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MAPKK) prevents the activation of the downstream ERK-A (MAPK). In contrast, blocking ERK-A expression results in increased activation of DSOR1. We also show that Drosophila AKT (DAKT) activation depends on the insulin receptor substrate, CHICO (IRS1–4). Finally, we demonstrate that blocking the expression of Drosophila PTEN results in the activation of DAKT. In all cases, the interference of the biochemical cascade by RNAi is consistent with the known steps in the pathway. We extend this powerful technique to study two proteins, DSH3PX1 and Drosophila ACK (DACK). DSH3PX1 is an SH3, phox homology domain-containing protein, and DACK is homologous to the mammalian activated Cdc42 tyrosine kinase, ACK. Using RNAi, we demonstrate that DACK is upstream of DSH3PX1 phosphorylation, making DSH3PX1 an identified downstream target/substrate of ACK-like tyrosine kinases. These experiments highlight the usefulness of RNAi in dissecting complex biochemical signaling cascades and provide a highly effective method for determining the function of the identified genes arising from the Drosophila genome sequencing project.},

The biochemical and functional properties of diverse actin-binding proteins, both alone and in combination, have been increasingly well studied. Conversely, how different sets of actin-binding proteins properly sort to distinct actin filament networks in the first place is not nearly as well understood. Actin-binding protein sorting is critical for the self-organization of diverse dynamic actin cytoskeleton networks within a common cytoplasm. Using in vitro reconstitution techniques including biomimetic assays and single-molecule multi-color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that sorting of the prominent actin-bundling proteins fascin and α-actinin to distinct networks is an intrinsic behavior, free of complicated cellular signaling cascades. When mixed, fascin and α-actinin mutually exclude each other by promoting their own recruitment and inhibiting recruitment of the other, resulting in the formation of distinct fascin- or α-actinin-bundled domains. Subdiffraction-resolution light microscopy and negative-staining electron microscopy revealed that fascin domains are densely packed, whereas α-actinin domains consist of widely spaced parallel actin filaments. Importantly, other actin-binding proteins such as fimbrin and espin show high specificity between these two bundle types within the same reaction. Here we directly observe that fascin and α-actinin intrinsically segregate to discrete bundled domains that are specifically recognized by other actin-binding proteins.},

Lpd contains a PH domain that binds specifically to PI(3,4)P2, an asymmetrically localized signal in chemotactic cells. Lpd's PH domain can localize to ruffles in PDGF-treated fibroblasts. Lpd overexpression increases lamellipodial protrusion velocity, an effect observed when Ena/VASP proteins are overexpressed or artificially targeted to the plasma membrane. Conversely, knockdown of Lpd expression impairs lamellipodia formation, reduces velocity of residual lamellipodial protrusion, and decreases F-actin content. These phenotypes are more severe than loss of Ena/VASP, suggesting that Lpd regulates other effectors of the actin cytoskeleton in addition to Ena/VASP.},

All family members share a tripartite structural organization, comprising an N-terminal Ena/VASP homology (EVH) 1 domain, a more divergent proline-rich central part, and a common C-terminal EVH2 region of about 160–190 amino acids. Using chemical cross-linking, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and gel filtration analyses of different truncated VASP constructs, we demonstrate that the VASP EVH2 region is both necessary and sufficient for tetramerization. Moreover, co-sedimentation and fluorescent phalloidin staining showed that the EVH2 region binds and bundles F-actin in vitro and localizes to stress fibers in transfected cells. Analysis of the functional contribution of highly conserved blocks within this region indicated that residues 259–276 of human VASP are essential for the interaction with F-actin, whereas residues 343–380 are required for tetramerization, probably via coiled-coil formation. Interactions with F-actin are enhanced by VASP tetramerization. The results demonstrate that the C-terminal EVH2 segment is not only conserved in sequence but also forms a distinct functional entity. The data suggest that the EVH2 segment represents a novel oligomerization and F-actin binding domain.},

Indeed, both hexagonal and disordered types of packing are observed in vivo. To investigate factors which control bundle order, as well as size, we examined the effect of protein concentration on the growth of actin-fascin bundles in vitro. We found that bundles require 4-8 d to achieve both maximum size and order. The largest and best ordered bundles were grown at low fascin and high actin concentrations (an initial fascin/actin ratio of 1:200). In contrast, a much larger number of poorly ordered bundles were formed at ratios of 1:25 and 1:50, and most surprisingly, no bundles were formed at 1:300 or 1:400. Based on these observations we propose a two-stage mechanism for bundle growth. The first stage is dominated by nucleation, which requires relatively high concentrations of fascin and which is therefore accompanied by rapid growth. Below some concentration threshold, nucleation ceases and bundles enter the second stage of slow growth, which continues until the supply of fascin is exhausted. By analogy with crystallization, we hypothesize that slower growth produces better order. We are able to use this mechanism to explain our observations as well as previous observations of bundle growth both in vitro and in vivo.},

To maintain mechanical homeostasis, cells must recognize and respond to changes in cytoskeletal integrity. By imaging live cells expressing fluorescently tagged cytoskeletal proteins, we observed that actin stress fibers undergo local, acute, force-induced elongation and thinning events that compromise their stress transmission function, followed by stress fiber repair that restores this capability. The LIM protein zyxin rapidly accumulates at sites of strain-induced stress fiber damage and is essential for stress fiber repair and generation of traction force. Zyxin promotes recruitment of the actin regulatory proteins α-actinin and VASP to compromised stress fiber zones. α-Actinin plays a critical role in restoration of actin integrity at sites of local stress fiber damage, whereas both α-actinin and VASP independently contribute to limiting stress fiber elongation at strain sites, thus promoting stabilization of the stress fiber. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism for rapid repair and maintenance of the structural integrity of the actin cytoskeleton.},

Nonetheless, how diverse neuronal class-specific dendrite branches are generated is not understood. We investigated specific classes of sensory neurons of Drosophila larvae to address the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation of distinct branch types. We addressed the function of fascin, a conserved actin-bundling protein involved in filopodium formation, in class III and class IV sensory neurons. We found that the terminal branchlets of different classes of neurons have distinctive dynamics and are formed on the basis of molecularly separable mechanisms; in particular, class III neurons require fascin for terminal branching whereas class IV neurons do not. In class III neurons, fascin controls the formation and dynamics of terminal branchlets. Previous studies have shown that transcription factor combinations define dendrite patterns; we find that fascin represents a downstream component of such programs, as it is a major effector of the transcription factor Cut in defining class III-specific dendrite morphology. Furthermore, fascin defines the morphological distinction between class III and class IV neurons. In fact, loss of fascin function leads to a partial conversion of class III neurons to class IV characteristics, while the reverse effect is obtained by fascin overexpression in class IV neurons. We propose that dedicated molecular mechanisms underlie the formation and dynamics of distinct dendrite branch types to elicit the accurate establishment of neuronal circuits.},

In addition, all structural information on formins has been limited to fragments. This has left open key questions about the structure, activity and regulation of intact formin proteins. Here, we isolated full-length mouse mDia1 (mDia1-FL) and found that it forms tightly autoinhibited dimers that can only be partially activated by RhoA. We solved the structure of autoinhibited mDia1-FL using electron microscopy and single particle analysis. Docking of crystal structures into the 3D reconstruction revealed that the fork-shaped N-terminal DID-CC region hangs over the ring-shaped FH2 domain, suggesting that autoinhibition results from steric obstruction of actin binding. Deletion of the C-terminal DAD domain extended mDia1 structure and activated it for actin assembly. Using TIRF microscopy, we observed that RhoA-activated mDia1-FL persistently accelerated filament elongation in the presence of profilin similar to mDia1 FH1-FH2 fragment. These observations validate the known activities of FH1-FH2 fragments as reflecting those of the intact molecule. Our results further suggest that mDia1-FL does not readily snap back into the autoinhibited conformation and dissociate from growing filament ends, and thus additional factors may be required to displace formins and restrict filament length.},

	abstract = {Fascin is the main actin filament bundling protein in filopodia. Because of the important role filopodia play in cell migration, fascin is emerging as a major target for cancer drug discovery. However, an understanding of the mechanism of bundle formation by fascin is critically lacking. Fascin consists of four β-trefoil domains. Here, we show that fascin contains two major actin-binding sites, coinciding with regions of high sequence conservation in β-trefoil domains 1 and 3. The site in β-trefoil-1 is located near the binding site of the fascin inhibitor macroketone and comprises residue Ser-39, whose phosphorylation by protein kinase C down-regulates actin bundling and formation of filopodia. The site in β-trefoil-3 is related by pseudo-2-fold symmetry to that in β-trefoil-1. The two sites are ∼5 nm apart, resulting in a distance between actin filaments in the bundle of ∼8.1 nm. Residue mutations in both sites disrupt bundle formation in vitro as assessed by co-sedimentation with actin and electron microscopy and severely impair formation of filopodia in cells as determined by rescue experiments in fascin-depleted cells. Mutations of other areas of the fascin surface also affect actin bundling and formation of filopodia albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting that, in addition to the two major actin-binding sites, fascin makes secondary contacts with other filaments in the bundle. In a high resolution crystal structure of fascin, molecules of glycerol and polyethylene glycol are bound in pockets located within the two major actin-binding sites. These molecules could guide the rational design of new anticancer fascin inhibitors.},

Focal adhesions are specialized regions of the cell surface where integrin receptors and associated proteins link the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. To define the cellular role of the focal adhesion protein zyxin, we characterized the phenotype of fibroblasts in which the zyxin gene was deleted by homologous recombination. Zyxin-null fibroblasts display enhanced integrin-dependent adhesion and are more migratory than wild-type fibroblasts, displaying reduced dependence on extracellular matrix cues. We identified differences in the profiles of 75- and 80-kD tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the zyxin-null cells. Tandem array mass spectrometry identified both modified proteins as isoforms of the actomyosin regulator caldesmon, a protein known to influence contractility, stress fiber formation, and motility. Zyxin-null fibroblasts also show deficits in actin stress fiber remodeling and exhibit changes in the molecular composition of focal adhesions, most notably by severely reduced accumulation of Ena/VASP proteins. We postulate that zyxin cooperates with Ena/VASP proteins and caldesmon to influence integrin-dependent cell motility and actin stress fiber remodeling.},

The C-terminal LIM region of zyxin directs the force-sensitive accumulation of zyxin on actin stress fibers. The N-terminal region of zyxin promotes actin reinforcement even when Rho kinase is inhibited. The mechanosensitive integrin effector p130Cas binds zyxin but is not required for mitogen-activated protein kinase–dependent zyxin phosphorylation or stress fiber remodeling in cells exposed to uniaxial cyclic stretch. α-Actinin and Ena/VASP proteins bind to the stress fiber reinforcement domain of zyxin. Mutation of their docking sites reveals that zyxin is required for recruitment of both groups of proteins to regions of stress fiber remodeling. Zyxin-null cells reconstituted with zyxin variants that lack either α-actinin or Ena/VASP-binding capacity display compromised response to mechanical stimulation. Our findings define a bipartite mechanism for stretch-induced actin remodeling that involves mechanosensitive targeting of zyxin to actin stress fibers and localized recruitment of actin regulatory machinery.},

More than 8000 actin crossover repeats, each with one to five alpha-actinin molecules bound, were selected, aligned, and grouped to produce class averages of alpha-actinin cross-links with approximately 9-fold improvement in the stochastic signal-to-noise ratio. Measurements and comparative molecular models show variation in the distance separating actin-binding domains and the angle of the alpha-actinin cross-links. Rafts of F-actin and alpha-actinin formed predominantly polar 2-D arrays of actin filaments, with occasional insertion of filaments of opposite polarity. Unique to this study are the numbers of alpha-actinin molecules bound to successive crossovers on the same actin filament. These "monofilament"-bound alpha-actinin molecules may reflect a new mode of interaction for alpha-actinin, particularly in protein-dense actin-membrane attachments in focal adhesions. These results suggest that alpha-actinin is not simply a rigid spacer between actin filaments, but rather a flexible cross-linking, scaffolding, and anchoring protein. We suggest these properties of alpha-actinin may contribute to tension sensing in actin bundles.},

Palladin is a multidomain protein, which associates with stress fibers in a variety of cell types. However, the exact role of palladin in stress fiber assembly and maintenance has remained obscure, and whether it functions as an actin filament crosslinker or scaffolding protein was unknown. We demonstrate that palladin is specifically required for the assembly of non-contractile dorsal stress fibers, and is, consequently, essential for the generation of stress fiber networks and the regulation of cell morphogenesis in osteosarcoma cells migrating in a three-dimensional collagen matrix. Importantly, we reveal that palladin is necessary for the recruitment of vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) to dorsal stress fibers and that it promotes stress fiber assembly through VASP. Both palladin and VASP display similar rapid dynamics at dorsal stress fibers, suggesting that they associate with stress fibers as a complex. Thus, palladin functions as a dynamic scaffolding protein that promotes the assembly of dorsal stress fibers by recruiting VASP to these structures.},

	abstract = {Formins constitute a large family of proteins that regulate the dynamics and organization of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Previously we showed that the formin mDia1 helps tether microtubules at the cell cortex, acting downstream of the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Here we further study the contributions of mDia1 and its two most closely related formins, mDia2 and mDia3, to cortical microtubule capture and ErbB2-dependent breast carcinoma cell migration. We find that depletion of each of these three formins strongly disrupts chemotaxis without significantly affecting actin-based structures. Further, all three formins are required for formation of cortical microtubules in a nonredundant manner, and formin proteins defective in actin polymerization remain active for microtubule capture. Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, we identify differential binding partners of the formin-homology domain 2 (FH2) of mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3, which may explain their nonredundant roles in microtubule capture. The FH2 domain of mDia1 specifically interacts with Rab6-interacting protein 2 (Rab6IP2). Further, mDia1 is required for cortical localization of Rab6IP2, and concomitant depletion of Rab6IP2 and IQGAP1 severely disrupts cortical capture of microtubules, demonstrating the coinvolvement of mDia1, IQGAP1, and Rab6IP2 in microtubule tethering at the leading edge.},

Ena/VASP is linked to actin filament elongation, whereas WASP plays a role in filament nucleation and branching mediated by Arp2/3 complex. The molecular mechanisms controlling both processes are only emerging. Both Ena/VASP and WASP are multidomain proteins. They both present poly-Pro regions, which mediate the binding of profilin–actin, followed by G-actin-binding (GAB) domains of the WASP-homology 2 (WH2) type. However, the WH2 of Ena/VASP is somewhat different from that of WASP, and has been poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that this WH2 binds profilin–actin with higher affinity than actin alone. The results are consistent with a model whereby allosteric modulation of affinity drives the transition of profilin–actin from the poly-Pro region to the WH2 and then to the barbed end of the filament during elongation. Therefore, the function of the WH2 in Ena/VASP appears to be to “process” profilin–actin for its incorporation at the barbed end of the growing filament. Conformational changes in the newly incorporated actin subunit, resulting either from nucleotide hydrolysis or from the G- to F-actin transition, may serve as a “sensor” for the processive stepping of Ena/VASP. Conserved domain architecture suggests that WASP may work similarly.},

Here we show that experimental manipulation of the balance between unbranched/branched nucleation altered the morphology and dynamics of Nck-induced actin comets. Inhibition of linear, formin-based nucleation with the small-molecule inhibitor SMIFH2 or overexpression of the formin FH1 domain resulted in formation of predominantly circular-shaped actin structures with low mobility (actin blobs). These results indicate that formin-based linear actin polymerization is critical for the formation and maintenance of Nck-dependent actin comet tails. Consistent with this, aggregation of an exclusively branched nucleation-promoting factor (the VCA domain of N-WASP), with density and turnover similar to those of N-WASP in Nck comets, did not reconstitute dynamic, elongated actin comets. Furthermore, enhancement of branched Arp2/3-mediated nucleation by N-WASP overexpression caused loss of the typical actin comet tail shape induced by Nck aggregation. Thus the ratio of linear to dendritic nucleation activity may serve to distinguish the properties of actin structures induced by various viral and bacterial pathogens.},

To identify profilin's essential properties, we built a combinatorial library of ScPFY variants containing either WT or SpPRF residues at multiple positions, and carried out a genetic selection to isolate variants that support life in fission yeast. We subsequently engineered ScPFY(9-Mut), a variant containing nine substitutions in the actin-binding region, which complements cdc3-124 cells. ScPFY(9-Mut), but not WT ScPFY, suppresses severe cytokinesis defects in cdc3-124 cells. Furthermore, the major activity rescued by ScPFY(9-Mut) is the ability to enhance cytokinesis formin Cdc12-mediated actin assembly in vitro, which allows cells to assemble functional contractile rings.

Defining how different tissues in vivo craft diverse protrusive behaviors using the same genomic toolkit of actin regulators is a current challenge. The actin elongation factors Diaphanous and Enabled both promote barbed-end actin polymerization and can stimulate filopodia in cultured cells. However, redundancy in mammals and Diaphanous' role in cytokinesis limited analysis of whether and how they regulate protrusions during development. We used two tissues driving Drosophila dorsal closure--migratory leading-edge (LE) and nonmigratory amnioserosal (AS) cells--as models to define how cells shape distinct protrusions during morphogenesis. We found that nonmigratory AS cells produce filopodia that are morphologically and dynamically distinct from those of LE cells. We hypothesized that differing Enabled and/or Diaphanous activity drives these differences. Combining gain- and loss-of-function with quantitative approaches revealed that Diaphanous and Enabled each regulate filopodial behavior in vivo and defined a quantitative "fingerprint"--the protrusive profile--which our data suggest is characteristic of each actin regulator. Our data suggest that LE protrusiveness is primarily Enabled driven, whereas Diaphanous plays the primary role in the AS, and reveal each has roles in dorsal closure, but its robustness ensures timely completion in their absence.},

We identify mDia1 and Fmnl3 as major factors enhancing actin polymerization and stabilizing E-cadherin at epithelial junctions. Fmnl3 localizes to adherens junctions downstream of Src and Cdc42, its depletion leads to a reduction in F-actin and E-cadherin at junctions, and weakening of cell-cell adhesion. Importantly, Fmnl3 expression is up-regulated and junctional localization increases during collective cell migration.

This structure undergoes extensive morphogenetic movements throughout its development and gives rise to all components of the inner ear. Ena/VASP-like (Evl) is an actin binding protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and organization. We have examined the role of Evl during the morphogenesis of the Xenopus inner ear. Evl (hereafter referred to as Xevl ) is expressed throughout otic vesicle formation and is enriched in the neuroblasts that delaminate to form the vestibulocochlear ganglion and in hair cells that possess mechanosensory stereocilia. Knockdown of Xevl perturbs epithelial morphology and intercellular adhesion in the otic vesicle and disrupts formation of the vestibulocochlear ganglion, evidenced by reduction of ganglion size, disorganization of the ganglion, and defects in neurite outgrowth. Later in embryogenesis, Xevl is required for development of mechanosensory hair cells. In Xevl knockdown embryos, hair cells of the ventromedial sensory epithelium display multiple abnormalities including disruption of the cuticular plate at the base of stereocilia and disorganization of the normal staircase appearance of stereocilia. Based on these data, we propose that Xevl plays an integral role in regulating morphogenesis of the inner ear epithelium and the subsequent development of the vestibulocochlear ganglion and mechanosensory hair cells.},

	abstract = {Actin bundle assembly in specialized structures such as microvilli on intestinal epithelia and Drosophila bristles requires two actin bundling proteins. In these systems, the distinct biochemical properties and temporal localization of actin bundling proteins suggest that these proteins are not redundant. During Drosophila oogenesis, the formation of cytoplasmic actin bundles in nurse cells requires two actin bundling proteins, fascin encoded by the singed gene and a villin-like protein encoded by the quail gene. singed and quail mutations are fully recessive and each mutation disrupts nurse cell cytoplasmic actin bundle formation. We used P-element mediated germline transformation to overexpress quail in singed mutants and test whether these proteins have redundant functions in vivo. Overexpression of quail protein in a sterile singed background restores actin bundle formation in egg chambers. The degree of rescue by quail depends on the level of quail protein overexpression, as well as residual levels of fascin function. In nurse cells that contain excess quail but no fascin, the cytoplasmic actin network initially appears wild type but then becomes disorganized in the final stages of nurse cell cytoplasm transport. The ability of quail overexpression to compensate for the absence of fascin demonstrates that fascin is partially redundant with quail in the Drosophila germline. Quail appears to function as a bundle initiator while fascin provides bundle organization.},

These filaments are hexagonally packed and in a longitudinal section they show a 12-nm periodicity in both the 1.1 and 1.0 views. From earlier studies this periodicity is attributable to cross-links and indicates that the filaments are maximally cross-linked, singed mutants also have 7-11 bundles, but the bundles are smaller, flattened, and the filaments within the bundles are randomly packed (not hexagonal); no periodicity can be detected in longitudinal sections. Another mutant, forked (f36a), also has 7-11 bundles but even though the bundles are very small, the filaments within them are hexagonally packed and display a 12-nm periodicity in longitudinal section. The singed-forked double mutant lacks filament bundles. Thus there are at least two species of cross-links between adjacent actin filaments. Hints of why two species of cross-links are necessary can be gleaned by studying bristle formation. Bristles sprout with only microtubules within them. A little later in development actin filaments appear. At early stages the filaments in the bundles are randomly packed. Later the filaments in the bundles become hexagonally packed and maximally cross-linked. We consider that the forked proteins may be necessary early in development to tie the filaments together in a bundle so that they can be subsequently zippered together by fascin (the singed gene product).},

Fascins function in the organisation of two major forms of actin-based structures: dynamic, cortical cell protrusions and cytoplasmic microfilament bundles. The cortical structures, which include filopodia, spikes, lamellipodial ribs, oocyte microvilli and the dendrites of dendritic cells, have roles in cell-matrix adhesion, cell interactions and cell migration, whereas the cytoplasmic actin bundles appear to participate in cell architecture. We discuss the current understanding of the cellular mechanisms that regulate the binding of fascin to actin and how these processes contribute to the organisation or disassembly of cell protrusions. Although the in vivo roles of fascin have been studied principally in Drosophila, several human diseases are associated with inherited or acquired alterations in the expression of fascins. Strategies to modulate fascin-containing protrusions and thereby cell adhesive and migratory behaviour could have potential for therapeutic intervention in these conditions.

Next to actin functions at the cell membrane, including different forms of membrane protrusions and invaginations, actin dynamics at intracellular membranes has recently become a research focus. Experiments addressing the vesicle-associated Spir WH2 domain containing actin nucleators have provided novel mechanistic insights into the function of actin dynamics at intracellular membranes. Spir proteins are targeted by a modified FYVE zinc finger motif toward endosomal and vesicle membranes, where they interact and cooperate with the distinct nucleators of the FMN subfamily of formins in the nucleation of actin filaments. The function of the Spir/formin actin nucleator complex is closely related to the Rab11 small G protein, which is a key regulator of recycling and exocytic transport processes. Together with the actin motor protein and Rab11 effector myosin Vb, Spir/formin nucleated actin filaments mediate actin-dependent vesicle transport processes. Drosophila and mouse genetic studies as well as cell biology experiments point toward an important role of the Spir/formin complex in oocyte maturation and in the structure and signaling of the nervous system.},

They contribute to different cellular actin cytoskeleton structures by their ability to polymerize straight actin filaments at the barbed end. While not all formins necessarily interact with Rho GTPases, a subgroup of mammalian formins, termed Diaphanous-related formins or DRFs, were shown to be activated by small GTPases of the Rho superfamily. DRFs are autoinhibited in the resting state by an N- to C-terminal interaction that renders the central actin polymerization domain inactive. Upon the interaction with a GTP-bound Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 GTPase, the C-terminal autoregulation domain is displaced from its N-terminal recognition site and the formin becomes active to polymerize actin filaments. In this review we discuss the current knowledge on the structure, activation, and function of formin-GTPase interactions for the mammalian formin families Dia, Daam, FMNL, and FHOD. We describe both direct and indirect interactions of formins with GTPases, which lead to formin activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The multifaceted function of formins as effector proteins of Rho GTPases thus reflects the diversity of the actin cytoskeleton in cells.},

Coordination between actin and microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics is critical during cell migration, phagocytosis, cytokinesis, and embryogenesis. However, the basis for cross-regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics is unclear. Henty-Ridilla et al. found that a component of the microtubule cytoskeleton accelerates actin filament elongation and protects the growing actin filament end (see the Perspective by Rottner). Thus, growing microtubules appear to be able to directly control the actin assembly machinery and actin filament dynamics.
Science, this issue p. 1004; see also p. 894
Microtubules (MTs) govern actin network remodeling in a wide range of biological processes, yet the mechanisms underlying this cytoskeletal cross-talk have remained obscure. We used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to show that the MT plus-end–associated protein CLIP-170 binds tightly to formins to accelerate actin filament elongation. Furthermore, we observed mDia1 dimers and CLIP-170 dimers cotracking growing filament ends for several minutes. CLIP-170–mDia1 complexes promoted actin polymerization {\textasciitilde}18 times faster than free–barbed-end growth while simultaneously enhancing protection from capping proteins. We used a MT-actin dynamics co-reconstitution system to observe CLIP-170–mDia1 complexes being recruited to growing MT ends by EB1. The complexes triggered rapid growth of actin filaments that remained attached to the MT surface. These activities of CLIP-170 were required in primary neurons for normal dendritic morphology. Thus, our results reveal a cellular mechanism whereby growing MT plus ends direct rapid actin assembly.
A mechanism for how microtubules can change actin dynamics is elucidated.

	abstract = {INF2 (inverted formin 2) is a formin protein with unique biochemical effects on actin. In addition to the common formin ability to accelerate actin nucleation and elongation, INF2 can also sever filaments and accelerate their depolymerization. Although we understand key attributes of INF2-mediated severing, we do not understand the mechanism by which INF2 accelerates depolymerization subsequent to severing. Here, we show that INF2 can create short filaments ({\textless}60 nm) that continuously turn over actin subunits through a combination of barbed end elongation, severing, and WH2 motif-mediated depolymerization. This pseudo-steady state condition occurs whether starting from actin filaments or monomers. The rate-limiting step of the cycle is nucleotide exchange of ADP for ATP on actin monomers after release from the INF2/actin complex. Profilin addition has two effects: 1) to accelerate filament turnover 6-fold by accelerating nucleotide exchange and 2) to shift the equilibrium toward polymerization, resulting in longer filaments. In sum, our findings show that the combination of multiple interactions of INF2 with actin can work in concert to increase the ATP turnover rate of actin. Depending on the ratio of INF2:actin, this increased flux can result in rapid filament depolymerization or maintenance of short filaments. We also show that high concentrations of cytochalasin D accelerate ATP turnover by actin but through a different mechanism from that of INF2.},

Nevertheless, endothelial cells are able to internalize large fibrin clots and apoptotic debris from the bloodstream, although the precise mechanism of such phagocytosis-like uptake is unknown. We show that cultured primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) internalize both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Listeria bacteria comparably, in a phagocytosis-like process. In contrast with previously studied host cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes, we find that endothelial internalization of Listeria is independent of all known pathogenic bacterial surface proteins. Consequently, we exploited the internalization and intracellular replication of L. monocytogenes to identify distinct host cell factors that regulate phagocytosis-like uptake in HUVEC. Using siRNA screening and subsequent genetic and pharmacologic perturbations, we determined that endothelial infectivity was modulated by cytoskeletal proteins that normally modulate global architectural changes, including phosphoinositide-3-kinase, focal adhesions, and the small GTPase Rho. We found that Rho kinase (ROCK) is acutely necessary for adhesion of Listeria to endothelial cells, whereas the actin-nucleating formins FHOD1 and FMNL3 specifically regulate internalization of bacteria as well as inert beads, demonstrating that formins regulate endothelial phagocytosis-like uptake independent of the specific cargo. Finally, we found that neither ROCK nor formins were required for macrophage phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes, suggesting that endothelial cells have distinct requirements for bacterial internalization from those of classical professional phagocytes. Our results identify a novel pathway for L. monocytogenes uptake by human host cells, indicating that this wily pathogen can invade a variety of tissues by using a surprisingly diverse suite of distinct uptake mechanisms that operate differentially in different host cell types.},

Further, mDia1 displaced from the barbed end by CP can randomly slide along the filament and later return to the barbed end to re-form the complex.

Here we describe the crystal structure of the KIND domain of human Spir1 alone and in complex with the tail of Fmn2, a mammalian ortholog of Cappuccino. The KIND domain is structurally similar to the C-lobe of protein kinases. The Fmn2 tail is coordinated in an acidic cleft at the base of the domain that appears to have evolved via deletion of a helix from the canonical kinase fold. Our functional analysis of Cappuccino reveals an unexpected requirement for its tail in actin assembly.

	abstract = {The actin nucleation factors Spire and Cappuccino interact with each other and regulate essential cellular events during Drosophila oogenesis in a cooperative fashion. The interaction blocks formin actin nucleation activity and enhances the Spire activity. Analogous to Spire and Cappuccino, the mammalian homologs Spir-1 and formin-2 show a regulatory interaction. To get an understanding of the nature of the Spir-formin cooperation, we have analyzed the interaction biochemically and biophysically. Our data shows that the association of Spir-1 and formin-2 is not significantly mediated by binding of the Spir-1-KIND domain to the formin FH2 core domain. Instead, a short sequence motif C-terminal adjacent to the formin-2-FH2 domain could be characterized that mediates the interaction and is conserved among the members of the Fmn subgroup of formins. In line with this, we found that both mammalian Spir proteins, Spir-1 and Spir-2, interact with mammalian Fmn subgroup proteins formin-1 and formin-2.},

Mutation of three residues within Rac1 results in a gain-of-function mutation for FMNL2 binding and reconstitution of the Cdc42 phenotype in vivo. Dimerization of FMNL1 through a parallel coiled coil segment leads to formation of an umbrella-shaped structure that—together with Cdc42—spans more than 15 nm in diameter.

The mechanism by which diverse formins regulate actin dynamics in plants is still not well understood. Using the in vitro single-molecule imaging technology, we directly observed that the FH1-FH2 domain of an Arabidopsis thaliana formin, AtFH14, processively attaches to the barbed end of actin filaments as a dimer and slows their elongation rate by 90\%. The attachment persistence of FH1-FH2 is concentration-dependent. Furthermore, by use of the triple-color TIRFM, we found that ABP29, a barbed-end capping protein, competes with FH1-FH2 at the filament barbed end, where its binding is mutually exclusive with AtFH14. In the presence of different plant profilin isoforms, FH1-FH2 enhances filament elongation rates from about 10 to 42 times. Filaments buckle when FH1-FH2 is anchored specifically to cover slides, further indicating that AtFH14 moves processively on the elongating barbed end. At high concentration, AtFH14 bundles actin filaments randomly into antiparallel or parallel spindle-like structures; however, the FH1-FH2-mediated bundles become thinner and longer in the presence of plant profilins. This is the direct demonstration of a processive formin from plants. Our results also illuminate the molecular mechanism of AtFH14 in regulating actin dynamics via association with profilin.},

Besides, molecular modeling of the T-isoform has recently provided a complete model of interaction with filamentous actin [Volkmann, N., DeRosier, D., Matsudaira, P., and Hanein, D. (2001) J. Cell Biol. 153, 947-956]. In this study, we report that recombinant L-plastin binds actin in a manner that strongly resembles that of the alpha-actinin-actin interface. The similitudes concern the absence of specificity toward the actin isoform and the inhibition of the binding by phosphoinositides. Furthermore, the participation of actin peptides 112-125 and 360-372 in the interface together with an inhibition of the rate of pyrenyl F-actin depolymerization is in favor of a lateral binding of the plastin isoform along the filament axis and strenghtens the similitudes in the way L-plastin and alpha-actinin bind to actin. We have also investigated the functional aspect and the putative equivalence of the two actin-binding domains of L-plastin toward actin binding. We demonstrate for the first time that the two recombinant fragments, expressed as single domains, have different affinities for actin. We further analyzed the difference using chemical cross-linking and F-actin depolymerization experiments assayed by fluorescence and high-speed centrifugation. The results clearly demonstrate that the two actin-binding domains of plastin display different modes of interaction with the actin filament. We discuss these results in light of the model of actin interaction proposed for T-plastin.},

Fascin is an actin-binding protein that is present predominantly in filopodia, which are believed to play a central role in normal and aberrant cell migration. An important outstanding question regards the molecular basis for the unique localization and functional properties of fascin compared with other actin crosslinking proteins. Here, we present the crystal structure of full-length Homo sapiens fascin-1, and examine its packing, conformational flexibility, and evolutionary sequence conservation. The structure reveals a novel arrangement of four tandem β-trefoil domains that form a bi-lobed structure with approximate pseudo 2-fold symmetry. Each lobe has internal approximate pseudo 2-fold and pseudo 3-fold symmetry axes that are approximately perpendicular, with β-hairpin triplets located symmetrically on opposite sides of each lobe that mutational data suggest are actin-binding domains. Sequence conservation analysis confirms the importance of hydrophobic core residues that stabilize the β-trefoil fold, as well as interfacial residues that are likely to stabilize the overall fascin molecule. Sequence conservation also indicates highly conserved surface patches near the putative actin-binding domains of fascin, which conformational dynamics analysis suggests to be coupled via an allosteric mechanism that might have important functional implications for F-actin crosslinking by fascin.},

Actin-binding proteins (ABPs) allow the cell to tailor the dimensions and mechanical properties of the bundles to suit specific biological functions. Therefore, it is important to obtain quantitative knowledge on the effect of ABPs on the mechanical properties of F-actin bundles. Here we measure the bending stiffness of F-actin bundles crosslinked by three ABPs that are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. We observe distinct regimes of bundle bending stiffness that differ by orders of magnitude depending on ABP type, concentration and bundle size. The behaviour observed experimentally is reproduced quantitatively by a molecular-based mechanical model in which ABP shearing competes with F-actin extension/compression. Our results shed new light on the biomechanical function of ABPs and demonstrate how single-molecule properties determine mesoscopic behaviour. The bending mechanics of F-actin fibre bundles are general and have implications for cytoskeletal mechanics and for the rational design of functional materials.},

From optical diffraction patterns of the micrographs, we deduced very similar models for both structures. The models consist of hexagonal arrays of actin filaments cross-linked by the second protein. The pattern of transverse bands in bundles derived from the sea urchin eggs is accounted for by postulating that the second protein is bonded to actin only at positions where cross-linking can occur, rather than being bonded to every actin. The helical symmetry of the actin requires that the bonding contacts involved in the cross-linking be slightly different at different positions along the length of the bundle. The technique of image reconstruction was used to obtain a three-dimensional map of the bundles from the acrosomal process.},

	abstract = {DeRosier et al. (1977) have proposed a structural model for the needles, which are bundles of hexagonally packed actin filaments crosslinked by fascin, a 58,000 Mr protein. An unusual consequence of their model is that the crossbridges are not uniformly spaced but follow a distinctive pattern whose repeat depends on the symmetry of the actin. From electron micrographs of needles, we have determined both the symmetry of the actin and the repeat of the pattern of crossbridges using a novel image-filtering algorithm. We find the pattern of crossbridges is correctly predicted by the symmetry of the actin. As part of the analysis, we produce a one-dimensional filtered image of the crossbridge which consists of a bilobal peak about 60 Å long in its axial dimension. More interestingly, the repeat of the pattern of crossbridges is so sensitive to the symmetry of the filaments that it allows us to determine actin symmetry to one part in 20,000 (i.e. the actin filaments in Fig. 1 have 2.1590 ± 0.0001 units per turn). Finally the filtering algorithm allows us to determine unambiguously the polarity of the bundle.

The algorithm we developed is an extension of computerized image filtering that is applicable to structures such as the needle in which the translational intervals between repeated objects are not all the same.},

Here, we examined the structure of the actin bundle formed by human fascin-1 (actin/fascin bundle), and its mode of interaction with myosin in vitro. The distance between cross-linked filaments in the actin/bundle was 8–9 nm, and the bundle showed the transverse periodicity of 36 nm perpendicular to the bundle axis, which was confirmed by electron microscopy. Decoration of the actin/fascin bundle with heavy meromyosin revealed that the arrowheads of filaments in the bundle pointed in the same direction, indicating that the bundle has polarity. This result suggested that fascin-1 plays an essential role in polarity of actin bundles in filopodia. In the in vitro motility assay, actin/fascin bundles slid as fast as single actin filaments on myosin II and myosin V. When myosin was attached to the surface at high density, the actin/fascin bundle disassembled to single filaments at the pointed end of the bundle during sliding. These results suggest that myosins may drive filopodial actin bundles backward by interacting with actin filaments on the surface, and may induce disassembly of the bundle at the basal region of filopodia.},

Using mutagenesis, we identified specific sequences in Smy1 critical for its in vitro inhibitory effects on the FH2 domain of the formin Bnr1. By integrating smy1 alleles targeting those sequences, we genetically uncoupled Smy1's functions in regulating formins and myosin. Quantitative imaging analysis further demonstrated that the ability of Smy1 to directly control Bnr1 activity is crucial in vivo for proper actin cable length, shape, and velocity and, in turn, efficient secretory vesicle transport. A Smy1-like sequence motif was also identified in a different Bnr1 regulator, Bud14, and found to be essential for Bud14 functions in regulating actin cable architecture and function in vivo. Together these observations reveal unanticipated mechanistic ties between two distinct formin regulators. Further, they emphasize the importance of tightly controlling formin activities in vivo to generate specialized geometries and dynamics of actin structures tailored to their physiological roles.},

Here we describe a mechanism by which Twinfilin and Cyclase-associated protein work in concert to accelerate depolymerization of actin filaments by 3-fold and 17-fold at their barbed and pointed ends, respectively. This mechanism occurs even under assembly conditions, allowing reconstitution and direct visualization of individual filaments undergoing tunable, accelerated treadmilling. Further, we use specific mutations to demonstrate that this activity is critical for Twinfilin function in vivo. These findings fill a major gap in our knowledge of cellular disassembly mechanisms, and suggest that depolymerization and severing may be deployed separately or together to control the dynamics and architecture of distinct actin networks.},

We test this model using constitutively active constructs of two formins, FMNL3 and mDia2. Surprisingly, filopodial assembly requirements differ between suspension and adherent cells. In suspension cells, Arp2/3 complex is required for filopodial assembly through either formin. In contrast, a subset of filopodia remains after Arp2/3 complex inhibition in adherent cells. In adherent cells only, mDia1 and VASP also contribute to filopodial assembly, and filopodia are disproportionately associated with focal adhesions.

This formin cooperates with profilin and Spire, a WASP homology domain 2 (WH2) repeat protein, to stimulate assembly of a dynamic cytoplasmic actin meshwork that facilitates translocation of the meiotic spindle in asymmetric division of mouse oocytes. The kinase-like non-catalytic domain (KIND) of Spire directly interacts with the C-terminal extension of the formin homology domain 2 (FH2) domain of Fmn2, called FSI. This direct interaction is required for the synergy between the two proteins in actin assembly. We have recently demonstrated how Spire, which caps barbed ends via its WH2 domains, activates Fmn2. Fmn2 by itself associates very poorly to filament barbed ends but is rapidly recruited to Spire-capped barbed ends via the KIND domain, and it subsequently displaces Spire from the barbed end to elicit rapid processive assembly from profilin·actin. Here, we address the mechanism by which Spire and Fmn2 compete at barbed ends and the role of FSI in orchestrating this competition as well as in the processivity of Fmn2. We have combined microcalorimetric, fluorescence, and hydrodynamic binding assays, as well as bulk solution and single filament measurements of actin assembly, to show that removal of FSI converts Fmn2 into a Capping Protein. This activity is mimicked by association of KIND to Fmn2. In addition, FSI binds actin at filament barbed ends as a weak capper and plays a role in displacing the WH2 domains of Spire from actin, thus allowing the association of actin-binding regions of FH2 to the barbed end.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actin filament bundling proteins mediate numerous processes in cells such as the formation of cell membrane protrusions or cell adhesions and stress fiber based locomotion. Among them alpha-actinin and fascin are the most abundant ones. This work characterizes differences in molecular motions in actin filaments due to the binding of these two actin bundling proteins.
METHODS: We investigated how alpha-actinin and fascin binding modify the conformation of actin filaments by using conventional and saturation transfer EPR methods.
RESULTS: The result characteristic for motions on the microsecond time scale showed that both actin bundling proteins made the bending and torsional twisting of the actin filaments slower. When nanosecond time scale molecular motions were described the two proteins were found to induce opposite changes in the actin filaments. The binding of one molecule of alpha-actinin or fascin modified the conformation of numerous actin protomers.
CONCLUSION: As fascin and alpha-actinin participates in different cellular processes their binding can serve the proper tuning of the structure of actin by establishing the right conformation for the interactions with other actin binding proteins. Our observations are in correlation with the model where actin filaments fulfill their biological functions under the regulation by actin-binding proteins.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Supporting the general model for the cellular regulation of the actin cytoskeleton we showed that two abundant actin bundling proteins, fascin and alpha-actinin, alter the conformation of actin filaments through long range allosteric interactions in two different ways providing the structural framework for the adaptation to specific biological functions.},

These properties, along with its ability to transition between monomeric (G-actin) and filamentous (F-actin) states under the control of nucleotide hydrolysis, ions, and a large number of actin-binding proteins, make actin a critical player in many cellular functions, ranging from cell motility and the maintenance of cell shape and polarity to the regulation of transcription. Moreover, the interaction of filamentous actin with myosin forms the basis of muscle contraction. Owing to its central role in the cell, the actin cytoskeleton is also disrupted or taken over by numerous pathogens.

The stress fiber contraction is maintained through dynamic molecular exchanges between preformed and cytoplasmic components. This isometric contraction has been recognized as being essential for extracellular matrix assembly and resultant wound healing. In addition, there have recently been increasing data suggesting that stress fibers under contraction by themselves work as a mechanosensitive element. In this review we discuss, from molecular and physical viewpoints, biomechanical properties of the stress fiber of non-motile cells such as contraction force, resistance to stretching, and their roles in keeping a mechanical homeostasis, which play vital roles in the mechanosensing process.},

The generation of actin arcs induced by Arp2/3 inhibition is arrested by formin inhibition., Recent studies have investigated the dendritic actin cytoskeleton of the cell edge's lamellipodial (LP) region by experimentally decreasing the activity of the actin filament nucleator and branch former, the Arp2/3 complex. Here we extend these studies via pharmacological inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex in sea urchin coelomocytes, cells that possess an unusually broad LP region and display correspondingly exaggerated centripetal flow. Using light and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that Arp2/3 complex inhibition via the drug CK666 dramatically altered LP actin architecture, slowed centripetal flow, drove a lamellipodial-to-filopodial shape change in suspended cells, and induced a novel actin structural organization during cell spreading. A general feature of the CK666 phenotype in coelomocytes was transverse actin arcs, and arc generation was arrested by a formin inhibitor. We also demonstrate that CK666 treatment produces actin arcs in other cells with broad LP regions, namely fish keratocytes and Drosophila S2 cells. We hypothesize that the actin arcs made visible by Arp2/3 complex inhibition in coelomocytes may represent an exaggerated manifestation of the elongate mother filaments that could possibly serve as the scaffold for the production of the dendritic actin network.},

One candidate recently implicated in these processes is the LIM domain protein zyxin, which can bind both Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) proteins and the actin filament cross-linking protein α-actinin. To characterize the localization and dynamics of zyxin in detail, we generated both monoclonal antibodies and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion construct. The antibodies colocalized with ectopically expressed GFP-VASP at focal adhesions and along stress fibers, but failed to label lamellipodial and filopodial tips, which also recruit Ena/VASP proteins. Likewise, neither microinjected, fluorescently labeled zyxin antibodies nor ectopically expressed GFP-zyxin were recruited to these latter sites in live cells, whereas both probes incorporated into focal adhesions and stress fibers. Comparing the dynamics of zyxin with that of the focal adhesion protein vinculin revealed that both proteins incorporated simultaneously into newly formed adhesions. However, during spontaneous or induced focal adhesion disassembly, zyxin delocalization preceded that of either vinculin or paxillin. Together, these data identify zyxin as an early target for signals leading to adhesion disassembly, but exclude its role in recruiting Ena/VASP proteins to the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia.},

	abstract = {Fimbrin belongs to a superfamily of actin  cross-linking proteins that share a conserved 27-kD actin-binding domain. This domain contains a tandem duplication of a sequence that is homologous to calponin.  Calponin homology (CH) domains not only cross-link  actin filaments into bundles and networks, but they also  bind intermediate filaments and some signal transduction proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. This fundamental role of CH domains as a widely used actin-binding  domain underlines the necessity to understand their  structural interaction with actin. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we have determined the three-dimensional  structure of F-actin and F-actin decorated with the  NH2-terminal CH domains of fimbrin (N375). In a difference map between actin filaments and N375-decorated actin, one end of N375 is bound to a concave surface formed between actin subdomains 1 and 2 on two  neighboring actin monomers. In addition, a fit of the  atomic model for the actin filament to the maps reveals  the actin residues that line, the binding surface. The  binding of N375 changes actin, which we interpret as a  movement of subdomain 1 away from the bound N375.  This change in actin structure may affect its affinity for  other actin-binding proteins and may be part of the regulation of the cytoskeleton itself. Difference maps between actin and actin decorated with other proteins  provides a way to look for novel structural changes in  actin.},

In this work, we explored some of the pathways that likely regulate actin dynamics in part via EVL (Ena/VASP-like protein). Two isoforms, EVL and EVL-I, were highly expressed in hematopoietic cells of thymus and spleen. In CD3-activated T-cells, EVL was found in F-actin-rich patches and at the distal tips of the microspikes that formed on the activated side of the T-cells. Like the other family members, EVL localized to focal adhesions and the leading edge of lamellipodia when expressed in fibroblasts. EVL was a substrate for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and this phosphorylation regulated several of the interactions between EVL and its ligands. Unlike VASP, EVL nucleated actin polymerization under physiological conditions, whereas phosphorylation of both EVL and VASP decreased their nucleating activity. EVL bound directly to the Abl, Lyn, and nSrc SH3 domains; the FE65 WW domain; and profilin, likely via its proline-rich core. Binding of Abl and nSrc SH3 domains, but not profilin or other SH3 domains, was abolished by cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation of EVL. We show strong cooperative binding of two profilin dimers on the polyproline sequence of EVL. Additionally, profilin competed with the SH3 domains for binding to partially overlapping binding sites. These data suggest that the function of EVL could be modulated in a complex manner by its interactions with multiple ligands and through phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide dependent kinases.},

A gliding filament assay is constructed in which a sparsely labeled actin filament (0.3\% of the actin monomers contain 6'- iodoacetamidotetramethylrhodamine [IATR]) is translocated by a field of unlabeled myosin V fixed to the surface. The polTIRFM twirling assay differs from a standard gliding filament assay in that full filaments are not visible, but rather individual fluorophores are spaced along each filament. The goal is to investigate possible rotational motions of the actin filament about its axis (i.e., twirling) by measuring the spatial angle of the fluorescent probe as a function of time. Successful assays contain microscopic fields of approximately 50 isolated points of fluorescence that move across the field in the presence of ATP. Actin is usually translocated by more than one myosin molecule, depending on the filament length and the myosin surface density. Sparsely labeled filaments are required because the orientation of only one probe can be resolved at a time.},

Shigella utilize the host actin cytoskeleton to enter cells, move through the cytoplasm of cells, and pass into adjacent cells.

We tested whether Ena/VASP family members VASP, Mena, or EVL contribute to S. flexneri spread through cell monolayers. VASP and EVL restrict cell-to-cell spread without significantly altering actin-based motility, whereas Mena had no effect on these processes. Phosphorylation of VASP on Ser-153, Ser-235, and Thr-274 regulates its sub-cellular distribution and function. VASP derivatives that lack the EVH1 domain or contain a phosphoablative mutation of Ser-153 were defective in restricting S. flexneri spread, indicating that the EVH1 domain and phosphorylation on Ser-153 are required for this process. The EVH1 domain and Ser-153 of VASP were required for VASP localization to focal adhesions, and localization of VASP to focal adhesions and/or the leading edge was required for restriction of spread. The contribution of the EVH1 domain was from both the donor and the recipient cell, whereas the contribution of Ser-153 phosphorylation was only from the donor cell. Thus, unlike host proteins characterized in Shigella pathogenesis that promote bacterial spread, VASP and EVL function to limit it. The ability of VASP and EVL to limit spread highlights the critical role of focal adhesion complexes and/or the leading edge in bacterial passage between cells.},

While it has been assumed that family members can form mixed oligomers, this possibility has not been investigated systematically. Using cells expressing controlled combinations of VASP, Mena and EVL, we evaluated the composition of Ena/VASP oligomers and found that VASP forms oligomers without apparent bias with itself, Mena or EVL. However, Mena and EVL showed only weak hetero-oligomerization, suggesting specificity in the association of Ena/VASP family members. Co-expression of VASP increased the ability of Mena and EVL to form mixed oligomers.

One important Ena/VASP regulator is the mig-10/Lamellipodin/RIAM family of adaptors that promote lamellipod formation in fibroblasts and drive neurite outgrowth and axon guidance in neurons. To better understand how MRL proteins promote actin network formation we studied the interactions between Lamellipodin (Lpd), actin, and VASP, both in vivo and in vitro. We find that Lpd binds directly to actin filaments and that this interaction regulates its subcellular localization and enhances its effect on VASP polymerase activity. We propose that Lpd delivers Ena/VASP proteins to growing barbed ends and increases their polymerase activity by tethering them to filaments. This interaction represents one more pathway by which growing actin filaments produce positive feedback to control localization and activity of proteins that regulate their assembly.},

	abstract = {Background
Bundles of unipolar actin filaments (F-actin), cross-linked via the actin-binding protein fascin, are important in filopodia of motile cells and stereocilia of inner ear sensory cells. However, such bundles are also useful as shuttles in myosin-driven nanotechnological applications. Therefore, and for elucidating aspects of biological function, we investigate if the bundle tendency to follow straight paths (quantified by path persistence length) when propelled by myosin motors is directly determined by material properties quantified by persistence length of thermally fluctuating bundles.
Methods
Fluorescent bundles, labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin, were studied at fascin:actin molar ratios: 0:1 (F-actin), 1:7, 1:4 and 1:2. Persistence lengths (Lp) were obtained by fitting the cosine correlation function (CCF) to a single exponential function: \&lt; cos(θ(0) − θ(s)) \&gt; = exp(−s / (2Lp)) where θ(s) is tangent angle; s: path or contour lengths. \&lt; \&gt; denotes averaging over filaments.
Results
Bundle-Lp (bundles \&lt; 15 μm long) increased from {\textasciitilde} 10 to 150 μm with increased fascin:actin ratio. The increase was similar for path-Lp (path \&lt; 15 μm), with highly linear correlation. For longer bundle paths, the CCF-decay deviated from a single exponential, consistent with superimposition of the random path with a circular path as suggested by theoretical analysis.
Conclusions
Fascin–actin bundles have similar path-Lp and bundle-Lp, both increasing with fascin:actin ratio. Path-Lp is determined by the flexural rigidity of the bundle.
General significance
The findings give general insight into mechanics of cytoskeletal polymers that interact with molecular motors, aid rational development of nanotechnological applications and have implications for structure and in vivo functions of fascin–actin bundles.},

In this report, we explored the capacity of Ena/VASP proteins to regulate the actin cytoskeleton at cadherin-adhesive contacts. We extended the observation that Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) proteins localize at cell–cell contacts to demonstrate that E-cadherin homophilic ligation is sufficient to recruit Mena to adhesion sites. Ena/VASP activity was necessary both for F-actin accumulation and assembly at cell–cell contacts. Moreover, we identified two distinct pools of Mena within individual homophilic adhesions that cells made when they adhered to cadherin-coated substrata. These Mena pools localized with Arp2/3-driven cellular protrusions as well as at the tips of cadherin-based actin bundles. Importantly, Ena/VASP activity was necessary for both modes of actin activity to be expressed. Moreover, selective depletion of Ena/VASP proteins from the tips of cadherin-based bundles perturbed the bundles without affecting the protrusive F-actin pool. We propose that Ena/VASP proteins may serve as higher order regulators of the cytoskeleton at cadherin contacts through their ability to modulate distinct modes of actin organization at those contacts.},

Here, we show that the N-terminal phosphorylation of HP1α plays a central role in its targeting to chromatin. Recombinant HP1α prepared from mammalian cultured cells exhibited a stronger binding affinity for K9-methylated histone H3 (H3K9me) than that produced in Escherichia coli. Biochemical analyses revealed that HP1α was multiply phosphorylated at N-terminal serine residues (S11-14) in human and mouse cells and that this phosphorylation enhanced HP1α's affinity for H3K9me. Importantly, the N-terminal phosphorylation appeared to facilitate the initial binding of HP1α to H3K9me by mediating the interaction between HP1α and a part of the H3 tail that was distinct from the methylated K9. Unphosphorylatable mutant HP1α exhibited severe heterochromatin localization defects in vivo, and its prolonged expression led to increased chromosomal instability. Our results suggest that HP1α's N-terminal phosphorylation is essential for its proper targeting to heterochromatin and that its binding to the methylated histone tail is achieved by the cooperative action of the chromodomain and neighboring posttranslational modifications.},

Using antibodies specific for each HP1 isoform, we showed that they segregate in distinct nuclear domains of human HeLa cells. By contrast, in mouse 3T3 interphase cells, HP1alpha and HP1beta are strictly colocalized. In mitotic HeLa cells, all of HP1alpha and a fraction of HP1beta and HP1gamma remain associated with chromosomes. Immunostaining of spread HeLa chromosomes showed that HP1alpha is mainly localized on centromeres as shown previously for HP1beta, while HP1gamma is distributed on discrete sites on the arms of chromosomes. Biochemical analysis showed that HP1alpha and HP1gamma are phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle, although more extensively in mitosis than in interphase, while HP1beta apparently remains unphosphorylated. Therefore, despite their extensive sequence conservation, mammalian HP1 isoforms differ widely in their nuclear localization, mitotic distribution and cell cycle-related phosphorylation. Thus, subtle differences in primary sequence and in posttranslational modifications may promote their targeting at different chromatin sites, generating pleiotropic effects.},

Although it has become feasible to rapidly identify proteins from crude cell extracts using mass spectrometry after two-dimensional electrophoretic separation, it can be difficult to elucidate low-abundance proteins of interest in the presence of a large excess of relatively abundant proteins. Therefore, for effective proteome analysis it becomes critical to enrich the sample to be analyzed in subfractions of interest. For example, the analysis of protein kinase substrates can be greatly enhanced by enriching the sample of phosphorylated proteins. Although enrichment of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins has been achieved through the use of high-affinity anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, the enrichment of phosphoserine/threonine-containing proteins has not been routinely possible. Here, we describe a method for enriching phosphoserine/threonine-containing proteins from crude cell extracts, and for subsequently identifying the phosphoproteins and sites of phosphorylation. The method, which involves chemical replacement of the phosphate moieties by affinity tags, should be of widespread utility for defining signaling pathways and control mechanisms that involve phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of serine/threonine residues.},

This neutral pH urea Triton-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system, or NUT-PAGE, separates proteins based on their charge at pH 7 and generates discrete bands from each acetylated and phosphorylated species. In addition, the gel is composed of common and inexpensive laboratory reagents, and requires only a single dimension of electrophoresis. We are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of this system by analyzing phosphorylated species of an acidic protein, α-synuclein, and both acetylated and phosphorylated species of a basic protein, histone H3. NUT-PAGE thus provides a cost-effective alternative to resolving acetylated and phosphorylated proteins, and potentially proteins with other post-translational modifications that alter net charge.},

	abstract = {The activity of Cdc2 (CDK1) kinase, which coordinates cell cycle progression and DNA break repair, is blocked upon its phosphorylation at tyrosine 15 (Y15) by Wee1 kinase in the presence of DNA damage. How Cdc2 can support DNA repair whilst being inactivated by the DNA damage checkpoint remains to be explained. Human CDK1 is phosphorylated by Myt1 kinase at threonine 14 (T14) close to its ATP binding site before being modified at threonine 161 (T167Sp) in its T-loop by the CDK-activating kinase (CAK). While modification of T161 promotes association with the cyclin partner, phosphorylation of T14 inhibits the CDK1-cyclin complex. This inhibition is further enforced by the modification of Y15 by Wee1 in the presence of DNA lesions. In S.pombe, the dominant inhibition of Cdc2 is provided by the phosphorylation of Y15 and only a small amount of Cdc2 is modified at T14 when cells are in S phase. Unlike human cells, both inhibitory modifications are executed by Wee1. Using the novel IEFPT technology, which combines isoelectric focusing (IEF) with Phos-tag SDS electrophoresis (PT), we report here that S.pombe Cdc2 kinase exists in seven forms. While five forms are phosphorylated, two species are not. Four phospho-forms associate with cyclin B (Cdc13) of which only two are modified at Y15 by Wee1. Interestingly, only one Y15-modified species carries also the T14 modification. The fifth phospho-form has a low affinity for cyclin B and is neither Y15 nor T14 modified. The two unphosphorylated forms may contribute directly to the DNA damage response as only they associate with the DNA damage checkpoint kinase Chk1. Interestingly, cyclin B is also present in the unphosphorylated pool. We also show that the G146D mutation in Cdc2.1w, which renders Cdc2 insensitive to Wee1 inhibition, is aberrantly modified in a Wee1-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work adds support to the idea that two distinct Cdc2 pools regulate cell cycle progression and the response to DNA damage.},

Phosphorylation of profilin resulted in significant decrease in actin polymerization (16.5\%), indicating an increased affinity of phosphoprofilin towards actin. The critical actin monomer concentration (Cc) increased to 260 nM in the presence of phosphoprofilin in comparison with 200 nM in the presence of profilin. The interaction of phosphoprofilin with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI (4,5)-P2] and poly (l-proline) (PLP) was examined by monitoring the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. Scatchard plot and binding isotherm data obtained revealed no difference in PI (4,5)-P2 binding between profilin and phosphoprofilin (Kd=20.4 μM), while poly (l-proline)-binding studies indicated a sixfold decrease (27.34 μM for profilin and 4.73 μM for phosphoprofilin) in Kd with phosphoprofilin. In vivo studies with platelets indicated an increased association of p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinse with phosphoprofilin over profilin. Overall, the data presented conclude that profilin phosphorylated under in vivo conditions and phosphorylation depends upon activation of PI 3-kinase.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A guides and enhances endothelial cell migration to initiate angiogenesis.

Here, we show that VEGF-A-inducible phosphorylation of Pfn-1 at Tyr 129 is critical for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Chemotactic activation of VEGF receptor kinase-2 (VEGFR2) and Src induces Pfn-1 phosphorylation in the cell leading edge, promoting Pfn-1 binding to actin and actin polymerization. Conditional endothelial knock-in of phosphorylation-deficient Pfn1(Y129F) in mice reveals that Pfn-1 phosphorylation is critical for angiogenesis in response to wounding and ischaemic injury, but not for developmental angiogenesis. Thus, VEGFR2/Src-mediated phosphorylation of Pfn-1 bypasses canonical, multistep intracellular signalling events to initiate endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, and might serve as a selective therapeutic target for anti-angiogenic therapy.},

	abstract = {Profilin 1 is a central regulator of actin dynamics. Mutations in the gene profilin 1 (PFN1) have very recently been shown to be the cause of a subgroup of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we performed a large screen of US, Nordic, and German familial and sporadic ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTLD) patients for PFN1 mutations to get further insight into the spectrum and pathogenic relevance of this gene for the complete ALS/FTLD continuum. Four hundred twelve familial and 260 sporadic ALS cases and 16 ALS/FTLD cases from Germany, the Nordic countries, and the United States were screened for PFN1 mutations. Phenotypes of patients carrying PFN1 mutations were studied. In a German ALS family we identified the novel heterozygous PFN1 mutation p.Thr109Met, which was absent in controls. This novel mutation abrogates a phosphorylation site in profilin 1. The recently described p.Gln117Gly sequence variant was found in another familial ALS patient from the United States. The ALS patients with mutations in PFN1 displayed spinal onset motor neuron disease without overt cognitive involvement. PFN1 mutations were absent in patients with motor neuron disease and dementia, and in patients with only FTLD. We provide further evidence that PFN1 mutations can cause ALS as a Mendelian dominant trait. Patients carrying PFN1 mutations reported so far represent the "classic" ALS end of the ALS-FTLD spectrum. The novel p.Thr109Met mutation provides additional proof-of-principle that mutant proteins involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics can cause motor neuron degeneration. Moreover, this new mutation suggests that fine-tuning of actin polymerization by phosphorylation of profilin 1 might be necessary for motor neuron survival.},

Here we identify a feedforward mechanism in which endothelial cells (ECs), in response to tumour-derived mediators, release angiocrines driving aberrant vascularization and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) progression through a hypoxia-independent induction of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. Phosphorylation of profilin-1 (Pfn-1) at Tyr 129 in ECs induces binding to the tumour suppressor protein von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), and prevents VHL-mediated degradation of prolyl-hydroxylated HIF-1α, culminating in HIF-1α accumulation even in normoxia. Elevated HIF-1α induces expression of multiple angiogenic factors, leading to vascular abnormality and tumour progression. In a genetic model of GBM, mice with an EC-specific defect in Pfn-1 phosphorylation exhibit reduced tumour angiogenesis, normalized vasculature and improved survival. Moreover, EC-specific Pfn-1 phosphorylation is associated with tumour aggressiveness in human glioma.

	abstract = {Myelination allows rapid saltatory propagation of action potentials along the axon and is an essential prerequisite for the normal functioning of the nervous system. During peripheral nervous system (PNS) development, myelin-forming Schwann cells (SCs) generate radial lamellipodia to sort and ensheath axons. This process requires controlled cytoskeletal remodeling, and we show that SC lamellipodia formation depends on the function of profilin 1 (Pfn1), an actin-binding protein involved in microfilament polymerization. Pfn1 is inhibited upon phosphorylation by ROCK, a downstream effector of the integrin linked kinase pathway. Thus, a dramatic reduction of radial lamellipodia formation is observed in SCs lacking integrin-linked kinase or treated with the Rho/ROCK activator lysophosphatidic acid. Knocking down Pfn1 expression by lentiviral-mediated shRNA delivery impairs SC lamellipodia formation in vitro, suggesting a direct role for this protein in PNS myelination. Indeed, SC-specific gene ablation of Pfn1 in mice led to profound radial sorting and myelination defects, confirming a central role for this protein in PNS development. Our data identify Pfn1 as a key effector of the integrin linked kinase/Rho/ROCK pathway. This pathway, acting in parallel with integrin β1/LCK/Rac1 and their effectors critically regulates SC lamellipodia formation, radial sorting and myelination during peripheral nervous system maturation.},

	volume = {9},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0103868},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Profilins are actin-modulating proteins regulating many intracellular functions based on their multiple and diverse ligand interactions. They have been implicated to play a role in many pathological conditions such as allergies, cardiovascular diseases, muscular atrophy, diabetes, dementia and cancer. Post-translational modifications of profilin 1 can alter its properties and subsequently its function in a cell. In the present study, we identify the importance of phosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 (S137) residue in breast cancer progression.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found elevated profilin 1 (PFN) in human breast cancer tissues when compared to adjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of wild-type profilin 1 (PFN-WT) in breast cancer MCF7 cells made them more migratory, invasive and adherent independent in comparison to empty vector transfected cells. Mutation in serine phosphorylation site (S137) of profilin 1 (PFN-S137A) significantly abrogated these properties. Mutation affecting actin-binding ability (PFN-R74E) of profilin 1 enhanced its tumorigenic function whereas mutation affecting its poly-L-proline binding function (PFN-H133S) alleviated these mechanisms in breast cancer cells. PFN-WT was found to activate matrix metalloproteinases by zymography, MMP2 and MMP9 in presence of PDBu (phorbol 12, 13 dibutyrate, PI3K agonist) to enhance migration and invasion in MCF7 cells while PFN-S137A did not. Phosphorylation increased migration and invasion in other mutants of profilin 1. Nuclear profilin levels also increased in the presence of PDBu.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies show that profilin could be executing a dual role in cancer by either suppressing or promoting tumorigenesis in a context dependent manner. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 enhances oncogenic properties in breast cancer cells. Inhibitors targeting profilin 1 phosphorylation directly or indirectly through inhibition of kinases that phosphorylate profilin could be valuable therapeutic agents that can alter its activity and thereby control the progression of cancer.},

The overexpression of profilin reduces the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded Htt and androgen receptor (AR) peptides. This requires profilin's G-actin binding activity and its direct interaction with Htt, which are both inhibited by the ROCK1-mediated phosphorylation of profilin at Ser-137. Y-27632 blocks the phosphorylation of profilin in HEK293 cells and primary neurons, which maintains profilin in an active state. The knockdown of profilin blocks the inhibitory effect of Y-27632 on both AR and Htt aggregation.

	abstract = {The morphology of astrocytic processes determines their close structural association with synapses referred to as the 'tripartite synapse'. Concerted morphological plasticity processes at tripartite synapses are supposed to shape neuronal communication. Morphological changes in astrocytes as well as the motility of astrocytic processes require remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Among the regulators of fast timescale actin-based motility, the actin binding protein profilin 1 has recently been shown to control the activity-dependent outgrowth of astrocytic processes. Here, we demonstrate that cultured murine astrocytes in addition to the ubiquitous profilin 1 also express the neuronal isoform profilin 2a. To analyze the cellular function of both profilins in astrocytes, we took advantage of a shRNA mediated isoform-specific downregulation. Interestingly, consistent with earlier results in neurons, we found redundant as well as isoform-specific functions of both profilins in modulating cellular physiology. The knockdown of either profilin 1 or profilin 2a led to a significant decrease in cell spreading of astrocytes. In contrast, solely the knockdown of profilin 2a resulted in a significantly reduced morphological complexity of astrocytes in both dissociated and slice culture astrocytes. Moreover, both isoforms proved to be crucial for forskolin-induced astrocytic stellation. Furthermore, forskolin treatment resulted in isoform-specific changes in the phosphorylation level of profilin 1 and profilin 2a, leading to a PKA-dependent phosphorylation of profilin 2a. In addition, transwell assays revealed an involvement of both isoforms in the motility of astrocytic processes, while FRAP analysis displayed an isoform-specific role of profilin 1 in the regulation of actin dynamics in peripheral astrocytic processes. Taken together, we suggest profilin isoforms to be important modulators of astrocytic morphology and motility with overlapping as well as isoform-specific functions.},

We previously identified Ser-137 of Pfn1 as a phosphorylation site within the poly-l-proline (PLP) binding pocket. Here we confirm that Ser-137 phosphorylation disrupts Pfn1 binding to its PLP-containing ligands with little effect on actin binding. We find in mouse xenografts of breast cancer cells that mimicking Ser-137 phosphorylation abolishes cell cycle arrest and apoptotic sensitization by Pfn1 and confers a growth advantage to tumors. This indicates a previously unrecognized role of PLP binding in Pfn1 antitumor effects. Spatial restriction of Pfn1 to the nucleus or cytoplasm indicates that inhibition of tumor cell growth by Pfn1 requires its nuclear localization, and this activity is abolished by a phosphomimetic mutation on Ser-137. In contrast, cytoplasmic Pfn1 lacks inhibitory effects on tumor cell growth but rescues morphological and proliferative defects of PFN1 null mouse chondrocytes. These results help reconcile seemingly opposed cellular effects of Pfn1, provide new insights into the antitumor mechanism of Pfn1, and implicate Ser-137 phosphorylation as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.},

TES interacts with a variety of cytoskeletal proteins including zyxin, mena, VASP, talin and actin. There is evidence that TES may function in actin-dependent processes as overexpression of TES results in increased cell spreading and decreased cell motility. Together with TES's interacting partners, these data suggest that TES might be involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, for the first time, we have used RNAi to successfully knockdown TES in HeLa cells and we demonstrate that loss of TES from focal adhesions results in loss of actin stress fibres. Similarly, and as previously reported, RNAi-mediated knockdown of zyxin results in loss of actin stress fibres. TES siRNA treated cells show reduced RhoA activity, suggesting that the Rho GTPase pathway may be involved in the TES RNAi-induced loss of stress fibres. We have also used RNAi to examine the requirement of TES and zyxin for each other's localisation at focal adhesions, and we propose a hierarchy of recruitment, with zyxin being first, followed by VASP and then TES.

Here we show that the formin-family actin nucleator, inverted formin 2 (INF2), localizes specifically to FAs and dorsal stress fibers (SFs) in fibroblasts. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy and manipulation of INF2 levels in cells indicate that INF2 plays a critical role at the SF-FA junction by promoting actin polymerization via free barbed end generation and centripetal elongation of an FA-associated actin bundle to form dorsal SF. INF2 assembles into FAs during maturation rather than during their initial generation, and once there, acts to promote rapid FA elongation and maturation into tensin-containing fibrillar FAs in the cell center. We show that INF2 is required for fibroblasts to organize fibronectin into matrix fibers and ultimately 3D matrices. Collectively our results indicate an important role for the formin INF2 in specifying the function of fibrillar FAs through its ability to generate dorsal SFs. Thus, dorsal SFs and fibrillar FAs form a specific class of integrated adhesion-associated actin structure in fibroblasts that mediates generation and remodeling of ECM.},

	abstract = {Organs and tissues adapt to acute or chronic mechanical stress by remodeling their actin cytoskeletons. Cells that are stimulated by cyclic stretch or shear stress in vitro undergo bimodal cytoskeletal responses that include rapid reinforcement and gradual reorientation of actin stress fibers; however, the mechanism by which cells respond to mechanical cues has been obscure. We report that the application of either unidirectional cyclic stretch or shear stress to cells results in robust mobilization of zyxin from focal adhesions to actin filaments, whereas many other focal adhesion proteins and zyxin family members remain at focal adhesions. Mechanical stress also induces the rapid zyxin-dependent mobilization of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein from focal adhesions to actin filaments. Thickening of actin stress fibers reflects a cellular adaptation to mechanical stress; this cytoskeletal reinforcement coincides with zyxin mobilization and is abrogated in zyxin-null cells. Our findings identify zyxin as a mechanosensitive protein and provide mechanistic insight into how cells respond to mechanical cues.},

	abstract = {Vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) can catalyze actin polymerization by elongating actin filaments. The elongation mechanism involves VASP oligomerization and its binding to profilin, a G-actin chaperone. Actin polymerization is required for tension generation during the contraction of airway smooth muscle (ASM); however the role of VASP in regulating actin dynamics in ASM is not known. We stimulated ASM cells and tissues with the contractile agonist acetylcholine (ACh) or the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin (FSK), a dilatory agent. ACh and FSK stimulated VASP Ser157 phosphorylation by different kinases. Inhibition of VASP Ser157 phosphorylation by expression of the mutant VASP S157A in ASM tissues suppressed VASP phosphorylation and membrane localization in response to ACh, and also inhibited contraction and actin polymerization. ACh but not FSK triggered the formation of VASP-VASP complexes as well as VASP-vinculin and VASP-profilin complexes at membrane sites. VASP-VASP complex formation and the interaction of VASP with vinculin and profilin were inhibited by expression of the inactive vinculin mutant, vinculin Y1065F, but VASP phosphorylation and membrane localization were unaffected. We conclude that VASP phosphorylation at Ser157 mediates its localization at the membrane, but that VASP Ser157 phosphorylation and membrane localization is not sufficient to activate its actin catalytic activity. The interaction of VASP with activated vinculin at membrane adhesion sites is a necessary prerequisite for VASP-mediated molecular processes necessary for actin polymerization. Our results show that VASP is a critical regulator of actin dynamics and tension generation during the contractile activation of ASM.},

Bundles of F-actin have been produced using the glycolytic enzymes aldolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the cytoskeletal protein erythrocyte adducin as well as smooth muscle alpha-actinin from chicken gizzard. All of the 2-D bundles formed contain F-actin with a 13/6 helical structure. F-actin-aldolase bundles have an interfilament spacing of 12.6 nm and a superlattice arrangement of actin filaments that can be explained by expression of a local twofold axis in the neighborhood of the aldolase. Well ordered F-actin-alpha-actinin 2-D bundles have an interfilament spacing of 36 nm and contain crosslinks 33 nm in length angled approximately 25–35 degrees to the filament axis. Images and optical diffraction patterns of these bundles suggest that they consist of parallel, unipolar arrays of actin filaments. This observation is consistent with an actin crosslinking function at adhesion plaques where actin filaments are bound to the cell membrane with uniform polarity.},

Using complementation of phenotypes in Ena/VASP-deficient cells and overexpression in normal fibroblasts, we have assayed the function of a panel of mutants in one member of this family, Mena, by mutating highly conserved sequence elements found in this protein family. Surprisingly, deletion of sites required for binding of the actin monomer-binding protein profilin, a known ligand of Ena/VASP proteins, has no effect on the ability of Mena to regulate random cell motility. Our analysis revealed two features essential for Ena/VASP function in cell movement, cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinase phosphorylation sites and an F-actin binding motif.

By analyzing stress fiber assembly pathways using live cell microscopy, we revealed that these structures are generated by two distinct mechanisms. Dorsal stress fibers, which are connected to the substrate via a focal adhesion at one end, are assembled through formin (mDia1/DRF1)–driven actin polymerization at focal adhesions. In contrast, transverse arcs, which are not directly anchored to substrate, are generated by endwise annealing of myosin bundles and Arp2/3-nucleated actin bundles at the lamella. Remarkably, dorsal stress fibers and transverse arcs can be converted to ventral stress fibers anchored to focal adhesions at both ends. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed that actin filament cross-linking in stress fibers is highly dynamic, suggesting that the rapid association–dissociation kinetics of cross-linkers may be essential for the formation and contractility of stress fibers. Based on these data, we propose a general model for assembly and maintenance of contractile actin structures in cells.},

Actin is a ubiquitous protein and is involved in important biological functions, but the definitive high-resolution structure of F-actin remains unknown. Although a recent atomic model well reproduced X-ray fibre diffraction intensity data from a highly oriented liquid-crystalline sol specimen, its refinement without experimental phase information has certain limitations. Direct visualization of the structure by electron cryomicroscopy, however, has been difficult because it is relatively thin and flexible. Here we report the F-actin structure at 6.6 Å resolution, made obtainable by recent advances in electron cryomicroscopy. The density map clearly resolves all the secondary structures of G-actin, such as α-helices, β-structures and loops, and makes unambiguous modelling and refinement possible. Complex domain motions that open the nucleotide-binding pocket on F-actin formation, specific D-loop and terminal conformations, and relatively tight axial but markedly loose interprotofilament interactions hydrophilic in nature are revealed in the F-actin model, and all seem to be important for dynamic functions of actin.},

Mammals possess at least 15 formin genes. A subset of formins termed “diaphanous formins” are regulated by autoinhibition through interaction between an N-terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) and a C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). Here, we found several striking features for the mouse formin, INF2. First, INF2 interacted directly with actin through a region C-terminal to the FH2. This second interacting region sequesters actin monomers, an activity that is dependent on a WASP homology 2 (WH2) motif. Second, the combination of the FH2 and C-terminal regions of INF2 resulted in its curious ability to accelerate both polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments. The mechanism of the depolymerization activity, which is novel for formin proteins, involves both the monomer binding ability of the WH2 and a potent severing activity that is dependent on covalent attachment of the FH2 to the C terminus. Phosphate inhibits both the depolymerization and severing activities of INF2, suggesting that phosphate release from actin subunits in the filament is a trigger for depolymerization. Third, INF2 contains an N-terminal DID, and the WH2 motif likely doubles as a DAD in an autoinhibitory interaction.},

Most organisms express multiple formins, but it has been unclear whether they have similar or distinct activities and how they may be regulated differentially. We isolated and compared the activities of carboxyl-terminal fragments of the only two formins expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bni1 and Bnr1. Bnr1 was an order of magnitude more potent than Bni1 in actin nucleation and processive capping, and unlike Bni1, Bnr1 bundled actin filaments. Profilin bound directly to Bni1 and Bnr1 and regulated their activities similarly. However, the cell polarity factor Bud6/Aip3 specifically bound to and stimulated Bni1, but not Bnr1. This was unexpected, since previous two-hybrid studies suggested Bud6 interacts with both formins. We mapped Bud6 binding activity to specific residues in the carboxyl terminus of Bni1 that are adjacent to its diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). Fusion of the carboxyl terminus of Bni1 to Bnr1 conferred Bud6 stimulation to a Bnr1-Bni1 chimera. Thus, Bud6 differentially stimulates Bni1 and not Bnr1. We found that Bud6 is up-regulated during bud growth, when it is delivered to the bud tip on Bni1-nucleated actin cables. We propose that Bud6 stimulation of Bni1 promotes robust cable formation, which in turn delivers more Bud6 to the bud tip, reinforcing polarized cell growth through a positive feedback loop.},

Here, we structurally and functionally dissect the nucleation-promoting C-terminal region of Bud6 into a Bni1-binding “core” domain and a G-actin binding “flank” domain. The ∼2-Å resolution crystal structure of the Bud6 core domain reveals an elongated dimeric rod with a unique fold resembling a triple-helical coiled-coil. Binding and actin-assembly assays show that conserved residues on the surface of this domain mediate binding to Bni1 and are required for NPF activity. We find that the Bni1 dimer binds two Bud6 dimers and that the Bud6 flank binds a single G-actin molecule. These findings suggest a model in which a Bni1/Bud6 complex with a 2:4 subunit stoichiometry assembles a nucleation seed with Bud6 coordinating up to four actin subunits.},

Previously suggested stair-stepping mechanisms of processive capping imply that a formin cap rotates persistently in one direction with respect to the filament. This challenges the formin-mediated mechanism of intracellular cable formation. We suggest a novel scenario of processive capping that is driven by developing and relaxing torsion elastic stresses. Based on the recently discovered crystal structure of an FH2–actin complex, we propose a second mode of processive capping—the screw mode. Within the screw mode, the formin dimer rotates with respect to the actin filament in the direction opposite to that generated by the stair-stepping mode so that a combination of the two modes prevents persistent torsion strain accumulation. We determine an optimal regime of processive capping, whose essence is a periodic switch between the stair-stepping and screw modes. In this regime, elastic energy does not exceed feasible values, and supercoiling of actin filaments is prevented.},

The signature formin homology 2 (FH2) domain initiates filament assembly and remains persistently associated with the fast-growing barbed end, enabling rapid insertion of actin subunits while protecting the end from capping proteins. On the basis of structural and mechanistic work, an integrated model is presented for FH2 processive motion. The adjacent FH1 domain recruits profilin-actin complexes and accelerates filament elongation. The most predominantly expressed formins in animals and fungi are autoinhibited through intramolecular interactions and appear to be activated by Rho GTPases and additional factors. Other classes of formins lack the autoinhibitory and/or Rho-binding domains and thus are likely to be controlled by alternative mechanisms.},

The Ena/VASP family of proteins has emerged as key to filopodia formation but the exact mechanism for how they function has yet to be fully elucidated. Using cell spreading as a model system in combination with small interfering RNA depletion of Capping Protein, we determined that Ena/VASP proteins have a role beyond anticapping activity in filopodia formation. Analysis of mutant Ena/VASP proteins demonstrated that the entire EVH2 domain was the minimal domain required for filopodia formation. Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching data indicate that Ena/VASP proteins rapidly exchange at the leading edge of lamellipodia, whereas virtually no exchange occurred at filopodial tips. Mutation of the G-actin-binding motif (GAB) partially compromised stabilization of Ena/VASP at filopodia tips. These observations led us to propose a model where the EVH2 domain of Ena/VASP induces and maintains clustering of the barbed ends of actin filaments, which putatively corresponds to a transition from lamellipodial to filopodial localization. Furthermore, the EVH1 domain, together with the GAB motif in the EVH2 domain, helps to maintain Ena/VASP at the growing barbed ends.},

This functional EGFP-actin construct enabled observation of the actin cytoskeleton in living cells by time lapse fluorescence microscopy. Stable expression of the construct was obtained in mammalian cell lines of different tissue origins. In stationary cells, actin rich, ring-like structured ‘actin clouds’ were observed in addition to stress fibers. These ruffle-like structures were found to be involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In migratory cells, EGFP-actin was found in the advancing lamellipodium. Immobile actin spots developed in the lamellipodium and thin actin fibers formed parallel to the leading edge.

We describe a novel role for Abl in early Drosophila development, where it regulates the site and type of actin structures produced. In Abl's absence, excess actin is polymerized in apical microvilli, whereas too little actin is assembled into pseudocleavage and cellularization furrows. These effects involve Ena misregulation. In abl mutants, Ena accumulates ectopically at the apical cortex where excess actin is observed, suggesting that Abl regulates Ena's subcellular localization. We also examined other actin regulators. Loss of Abl leads to changes in the localization of the Arp2/3 complex and the formin Diaphanous, and mutations in diaphanous or capping protein beta enhance abl phenotypes.},

However, the cellular functions of VASP are not known. In this study, we have expressed wild-type and mutant forms of VASP in endothelial cells to determine in what aspects of cytoskeletal behavior this protein participates. Expression of wild-type VASP induces marked membrane ruffling and formation of prominent stress fibers in bovine aortic endothelial cells. Deletion of the proline-rich domain of VASP abolishes its ability to bind profilin but does not affect ruffling or stress fiber formation. Further deletions reveal a sequence within the carboxy-terminal domain that is responsible for in vivo bundle formation. Ruffling occurs only on the expression of forms of VASP that possess bundling activity and the capacity to bind zyxin/vinculin-derived peptide. The ability of distinct subdomains within VASP to bind adhesion proteins and induce F-actin bundling in vivo suggests that this protein could function in the aggregation and tethering of actin filaments during the formation of endothelial cell-substrate and cell-cell contacts. These data provide a mechanism whereby VASP can influence endothelial migration and organization during capillary formation and modulate vascular permeability via effects on endothelial cell contractility.},

We have explored the possibility of active transport of G-actin by myosin motors, which would be an expected biological response to overcome the limitation of a diffusion-based process. We found that in a straightforward implementation of active transport the increase in length was unimpressive, {\textless} or = 30\%, due to sequestering of G-actin by freely diffusing motors. However, artificially removing motor sequestration reactions led to approximately threefold increases in filopodial length, with the transport being mainly limited by the motors failing to detach from the filaments near the tip, clogging the cooperative conveyer belt dynamics. Making motors sterically transparent led to a qualitative change of the dynamics to a different regime of steady growth without a stationary length. Having identified sequestration and clogging as ubiquitous constraints to motor-driven transport, we devised and tested a speculative means to sidestep these limitations in filopodia by employing cross-linking and putative scaffolding roles of Ena/VASP proteins. We conclude that a naïve design of molecular-motor-based active transport would almost always be inefficient--an intricately organized kinetic scheme, with finely tuned rate constants, is required to achieve high-flux transport.},

In membranes of platelets low concentrations of cAMP (0.5-2 microM) stimulated the phosphorylation of five major proteins with apparent relative molecular masses, Mr, of 240 000, 130 000, 50 000, 42 000 and 22 000 while low concentrations of cGMP (0.5-2 microM) stimulated the phosphorylation of three major proteins with apparent Mr of 130 000, 50 000 and 46 000. An affinity-purified antibody against the cGMP-dependent protein kinase was prepared which specifically inhibited the activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. In membranes of human platelets this affinity-purified antibody inhibited the cGMP-stimulated phosphorylation of the three proteins with Mr of 130 000, 50 000 and 46 000 while it had no effect on the cAMP-dependent and cyclic-nucleotide-independent protein phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that platelets contain a cGMP-dependent protein kinase and at least three specific substrates for this enzyme. Two of these substrates, the proteins with apparent molecular Mr of 130 000 and 50 000, are substrates for both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The protein with apparent Mr of 130 000 appears to be closely related to an intrinsic plasma membrane protein of vascular smooth muscle cells which is a substrate for a membrane-associated cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Therefore, cGMP-dependent protein kinase and cGMP-regulated phosphoproteins may mediate in platelets the intracellular effects of those hormones, vasodilators and drugs which elevate the level of cGMP and inhibit platelet aggregation.},

Using live-cell imaging with GFP-tagged proteins and correlative electron microscopy, we performed a kinetic-structural analysis of filopodial initiation in B16F1 melanoma cells. Filopodial bundles arose not by a specific nucleation event, but by reorganization of the lamellipodial dendritic network analogous to fusion of established filopodia but occurring at the level of individual filaments. Subsets of independently nucleated lamellipodial filaments elongated and gradually associated with each other at their barbed ends, leading to formation of cone-shaped structures that we term Λ-precursors. An early marker of initiation was the gradual coalescence of GFP-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (GFP-VASP) fluorescence at the leading edge into discrete foci. The GFP-VASP foci were associated with Λ-precursors, whereas Arp2/3 was not. Subsequent recruitment of fascin to the clustered barbed ends of Λ-precursors initiated filament bundling and completed formation of the nascent filopodium. We propose a convergent elongation model of filopodia initiation, stipulating that filaments within the lamellipodial dendritic network acquire privileged status by binding a set of molecules (including VASP) to their barbed ends, which protect them from capping and mediate association of barbed ends with each other.},

Activation of cell surface receptors generates signals (including activated Rho family GTPases) that converge on integrating proteins of the WASp family (WASp, N-WASP, and Scar/WAVE). WASP family proteins stimulate Arp2/3 complex to nucleate actin filaments, which grow at a fixed 70 degrees angle from the side of pre-existing actin filaments. These filaments push the membrane forward as they grow at their barbed ends. Arp2/3 complex is incorporated into the network, and new filaments are capped rapidly, so that activated Arp2/3 complex must be supplied continuously to keep the network growing. Hydrolysis of ATP bound to polymerized actin followed by phosphate dissociation marks older filaments for depolymerization by ADF/cofilins. Profilin catalyzes exchange of ADP for ATP, recycling actin back to a pool of unpolymerized monomers bound to profilin and thymosin-beta 4 that is poised for rapid elongation of new barbed ends.},

	abstract = {We review recent structural and biophysical studies of the mechanism of action of formins, proteins that direct the assembly of unbranched actin filaments for cytokinetic contractile rings and other cellular structures. Formins use free actin monomers to nucleate filaments and then remain bound to the barbed ends of these filaments as they elongate. In addition to variable regulatory domains, formins typically have formin homology 1 (FH1) and formin homology 2 (FH2) domains. FH1 domains have multiple binding sites for profilin, an abundant actin monomer binding protein. FH2 homodimers encircle the barbed end of a filament. Most FH2 domains inhibit actin filament elongation, but FH1 domains concentrate multiple profilin-actin complexes near the end of the filament. Actin transfers very rapidly from the FH1 domains onto the barbed end of the filament, allowing elongation at rates that exceed elongation by the addition of free actin monomers diffusing in solution. Binding of actin to the end of the filament provides the energy for the highly processive movement of the FH2 as a filament adds thousands of actin subunits. These biophysical insights provide the context to understand how formins contribute to actin assembly in cells.},

A ctin filaments, with the aid of multiple accessory proteins, self-assemble into a variety of network patterns. We studied the organization and dynamics of the actin network in nonadhesive regions of cells bridging fibronectin-coated adhesive strips. The network was formed by actin nodes associated with and linked by myosin II and containing the formin disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (DAAM1) and the cross-linker filamin A (FlnA). After Latrunculin A (LatA) addition, actin nodes appeared to be more prominent and demonstrated drift-diffusion motion. Superresolution microscopy revealed that, in untreated cells, DAAM1 formed patches with a similar spatial arrangement to the actin nodes. Node movement (diffusion coefficient and velocity) in LatA-treated cells was dependent on the level and activity of myosin IIA, DAAM1, and FlnA. Based on our results, we developed a computational model of the dynamic formin-filamin-actin asters that can self-organize into a contractile actomyosin network. We suggest that such networks are critical for connecting distant parts of the cell to maintain the mechanical coherence of the cytoplasm.},

VASP contains a central proline-rich sequence which recruits the G-actin binding protein profilin. Localization of VASP to the leading edge of a migrating cell can lead to local accumulation of profilin, which in turn can supply actin monomers to growing filament ends. VASP binds to the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and zyxin and this probably directs the phosphoprotein to focal adhesions and the leading edge of stimulated cells. VASP functions as a binding intermediate between profilin and focal adhesion proteins. Intracellular pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, have coat proteins which bind VASP. This is one way in which these pathogens use VASP, and other proteins from the host cell, to assemble the actin filaments they require to move around the cytoplasm of infected cells and enter neighbouring cells. Understanding the role of VASP and other proteins in cell and bacterial motility is likely to lead to development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases including atherosclerosis and tumour growth, and for limiting the spread of intracellular pathogens.},

The formin homology 2 (FH2) domain is central to these activities, but recent work has suggested that additional sequences enhance FH2 domain function. Here we show that the C-terminal 76 amino acids of the formin FMNL3 have a dramatic effect on the ability of the FH2 domain to accelerate actin assembly. This C-terminal region contains a WASp homology 2 (WH2)-like sequence that binds actin monomers in a manner that is competitive with other WH2 domains and with profilin. In addition, the C terminus binds filament barbed ends. As a monomer, the FMNL3 C terminus inhibits actin polymerization and slows barbed end elongation with moderate affinity. As a dimer, the C terminus accelerates actin polymerization from monomers and displays high affinity inhibition of barbed end elongation. These properties are not common to all formin C termini, as those of mDia1 and INF2 do not behave similarly. Interestingly, mutation of two aliphatic residues, which blocks high affinity actin binding by the WH2-like sequence, has no effect on the ability of the C terminus to enhance FH2-mediated polymerization. However, mutation of three successive basic residues at the C terminus of the WH2-like sequence compromises polymerization enhancement. These results illustrate that the C termini of formins are highly diverse in their interactions with actin.},

While earlier studies unambiguously demonstrated that profilin · actin is highly concentrated within the polymerization zone, profilin-actin localization on the motile surface cannot increase the local solution-phase concentration of polymerizable actin. To explain these high rates of actin polymerization, we present and analyze a novel polymerization model in which monomers are directly transferred to growing filament ends in the actoclampin motor.

	abstract = {Although actin-based motility drives cell crawling and intracellular locomotion of organelles and certain pathogens, the underlying mechanism of force generation remains a mystery. Recent experiments demonstrated that Listeria exhibit episodes of 5.4-nm stepwise motion corresponding to the periodicity of the actin filament subunits, and extremely small positional fluctuations during the intermittent pauses [S. C. Kuo and J. L. McGrath. 2000. Nature. 407:1026-1029]. These findings suggest that motile bacteria remain firmly bound to actin filament ends as they elongate, a behavior that appears to rule out previous models for actin-based motility. We propose and analyze a new mechanochemical model (called the "Lock, Load \& Fire" mechanism) for force generation by means of affinity-modulated, clamped-filament elongation. During the locking step, the filament's terminal ATP-containing subunit binds tightly to a clamp situated on the surface of a motile object; in the loading step, actin.ATP monomer(s) bind to the filament end, an event that triggers the firing step, wherein ATP hydrolysis on the clamped subunit attenuates the filament's affinity for the clamp. This last step initiates translocation of the new ATP-containing terminus to the clamp, whereupon another cycle begins anew. This model explains how surface-tethered filaments can grow while exerting flexural or tensile force on the motile surface. Moreover, stochastic simulations of the model reproduce the signature motions of Listeria. This elongation motor, which we term actoclampin, exploits actin's intrinsic ATPase activity to provide a simple, high-fidelity enzymatic reaction cycle for force production that does not require elongating filaments to dissociate from the motile surface. This mechanism may operate whenever actin polymerization is called upon to generate the forces that drive cell crawling or intracellular organelle motility.},

This interaction increases cell migration and enables VASP to cooperatively enhance WRC stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly in vitro in the presence of Rac. Loss of this interaction in Drosophila macrophages results in defects in lamellipodia formation, cell spreading, and redistribution of Ena to the tips of filopodia-like extensions.

Yet, the spatiotemporal coordination of actin regulators in spines is unknown. Using single protein tracking and super-resolution imaging, we revealed the nanoscale organization and dynamics of branched F-actin regulators in spines. Branched F-actin nucleation occurs at the PSD vicinity, while elongation occurs at the tip of finger-like protrusions. This spatial segregation differs from lamellipodia where both branched F-actin nucleation and elongation occur at protrusion tips. The PSD is a persistent confinement zone for IRSp53 and the WAVE complex, an activator of the Arp2/3 complex. In contrast, filament elongators like VASP and formin-like protein-2 move outwards from the PSD with protrusion tips. Accordingly, Arp2/3 complexes associated with F-actin are immobile and surround the PSD. Arp2/3 and Rac1 GTPase converge to the PSD, respectively, by cytosolic and free-diffusion on the membrane. Enhanced Rac1 activation and Shank3 over-expression, both associated with spine enlargement, induce delocalization of the WAVE complex from the PSD. Thus, the specific localization of branched F-actin regulators in spines might be reorganized during spine morphological remodeling often associated with synaptic plasticity.},

	abstract = {Site-directed actin polymerisation in response to signalling is responsible for the formation of cell protrusions. These elementary 'actin-based motility processes' are involved in cell locomotion, cell metastasis, organ morphogenesis and microbial pathogenesis. We have reconstituted actin-based propulsive movement of particles of various sizes and geometries (rods, microspheres) in a minimum motility medium containing five pure proteins. The ATP-supported treadmilling of actin filaments, regulated by Actin Depolymerizing Factor (ADF/cofilin), profilin and capping proteins provides the thermodynamic basis for sustained actin-based movement. Local activation of Arp2/3 complex at the surface of the particle promotes autocatalytic barbed end branching of filaments, generating a polarized arborescent array. Barbed end growth of branched filaments against the surface generates a propulsive force and is eventually arrested by capping proteins. Understanding the mechanism of actin-based movement requires elucidation of the biochemical properties and mode of action of Arp2/3 complex in filament branching, in particular the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in Arp2/3, and a physical analysis of the movement of functionalised particles. Because the functionalisation of the particle by an activator of Arp2/3 complex (N-WASP or the Listeria protein ActA) and the concentrations of effectors in the medium are controlled, the reconstituted motility assay allows an analysis of the mechanism of force production at the mesoscopic and molecular levels.},

	abstract = {α-Actinins are a major class of actin filament cross-linking proteins expressed in virtually all cells. In muscle, actinins cross-link thin filaments from adjacent sarcomeres. In non-muscle cells, different actinin isoforms play analogous roles in cross-linking actin filaments and anchoring them to structures such as cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions. Although actinins have long been known to play roles in cytokinesis, cell adhesion and cell migration, recent studies have provided further mechanistic insights into these functions. Roles for actinins in synaptic plasticity and membrane trafficking events have emerged more recently, as has a 'non-canonical' function for actinins in transcriptional regulation in the nucleus. In the present paper we review recent advances in our understanding of these diverse cell biological functions of actinins in non-muscle cells, as well as their roles in cancer and in genetic disorders affecting platelet and kidney physiology. We also make two proposals with regard to the actinin nomenclature. First, we argue that naming actinin isoforms according to their expression patterns is problematic and we suggest a more precise nomenclature system. Secondly, we suggest that the α in α-actinin is superfluous and can be omitted.},

	abstract = {The ability of skeletal muscles to produce force at a high velocity, which is crucial for success in power and sprint performance, is strongly influenced by genetics and without the appropriate genetic make-up, an individual reduces his/her chances of becoming an exceptional power or sprinter athlete. Several genetic variants (i.e. polymorphisms) have been associated with elite power and sprint performance in the last few years and the current paradigm is that elite performance is a polygenic trait, with minor contributions of each variant to the unique athletic phenotype. The purpose of this review is to summarize the specific knowledge in the field of genetics and elite power performance, and to provide some future directions for research in this field. Of the polymorphisms associated with elite power and sprint performance, the α-actinin-3 R577X polymorphism provides the most consistent results. ACTN3 is the only gene that shows a genotype and performance association across multiple cohorts of elite power athletes, and this association is strongly supported by mechanistic data from an Actn3 knockout mouse model. The angiotensin-1 converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism (ACE I/D, registered single nucleotide polymorphism [rs]4646994), angiotensinogen (AGT Met235Thr rs699), skeletal adenosine monophosphate deaminase (AMPD1) Gln(Q)12Ter(X) [also termed C34T, rs17602729], interleukin-6 (IL-6 -174 G/C, rs1800795), endothelial nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3 -786 T/C, rs2070744; and Glu298Asp, rs1799983), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARA Intron 7 G/C, rs4253778), and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2 Ala55Val, rs660339) polymorphisms have also been associated with elite power performance, but the findings are less consistent. In general, research into the genetics of athletic performance is limited by a small sample size in individual studies and the heterogeneity of study samples, often including athletes from multiple-difference sporting disciplines. In the future, large, homogeneous, strictly defined elite power athlete cohorts need to be established though multinational collaboration, so that meaningful genome-wide association studies can be performed. Such an approach would provide unbiased identification of potential genes that influence elite athletic performance.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells use cytoskeletal proteins to regulate and modify cell shape. During cytokinesis or eukaryotic cell crawling, contractile forces are generated inside the cell to constrict the division site or to haul the rear of the cell forward, respectively. In many cases, these forces have been attributed to the activity of molecular motors, such as myosin II, which, by pulling on actin filaments, can produce contraction of the actin cytoskeleton. However, prokaryotic division is driven by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ and does not seem to require additional molecular motors to constrict the division site. Likewise, Dictyostelium discoideum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae can perform cytokinesis under motor-free conditions. In addition, many crawling cells can translocate when myosin is inhibited or absent. In this review, we point out another force-generation mechanism that can play a significant role in driving these processes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. This mechanism is mediated by cross-linking and bundling proteins that form effective interactions between cytoskeletal filaments. Some recent studies in this area are reviewed and the physical underpinnings of this force-generation mechanism are explained.},

	abstract = {Interactions between dynamic microtubules and actin filaments are essential to a wide range of cell biological processes including cell division, motility and morphogenesis. In neuronal growth cones, interactions between microtubules and actin filaments in filopodia are necessary for growth cones to make a turn. Growth-cone turning is a fundamental behaviour during axon guidance, as correct navigation of the growth cone through the embryo is required for it to locate an appropriate synaptic partner. Microtubule-actin filament interactions also occur in the transition zone and central domain of the growth cone, where actin arcs exert compressive forces to corral microtubules into the core of the growth cone and thereby facilitate microtubule bundling, a requirement for axon formation. We now have a fairly comprehensive understanding of the dynamic behaviour of the cytoskeleton in growth cones, and the stage is set for discovering the molecular machinery that enables microtubule-actin filament coupling in growth cones, as well as the intracellular signalling pathways that regulate these interactions. Furthermore, recent experiments suggest that microtubule-actin filament interactions might also be important for the formation of dendritic spines from filopodia in mature neurons. Therefore, the mechanisms coupling microtubules to actin filaments in growth-cone turning and dendritic-spine maturation might be conserved.},

A large and diverse cast of characters, accessory proteins known as actin-binding proteins, modulate actin dynamics. They do this by binding to the monomer pool, interacting with the side and ends of filaments, creating breaks along a filament, and generating new filaments de novo. Recent biochemical and single-filament imaging analyses of several conserved classes of plant actin-binding proteins reveal unusual and unexpected properties. Examples that are highlighted in this review include: an abundant monomer-binding protein that catalyzes nucleotide exchange; a barbed-end capping protein that is dissociated from filament ends by the signaling lipid, phosphatidic acid; a villin-like bundling protein that lacks all Ca2+-regulated activities; and a formin family member that is non-processive and is sufficient to generate actin filament bundles. These and other stories motivate a careful description of the properties of plant proteins in vitro as a prelude to greater insight into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the regulation of actin dynamics in vivo.},

The spectrin family is characterized by the presence of spectrin repeats, actin binding domains, and EF hands. With increasing divergence, new domains and functions have been added such that spectrin and dystrophin also contain specialized protein-protein interaction motifs and regions for interaction with membranes and phospholipids. The acquisition of new domains also increased the functional complexity of the family such that the proteins perform a range of tasks way beyond the simple bundling of actin filaments by α-actinin in S. pombe.

In the case of the actin cytoskeleton, a great deal is known about the components that include higher order structures, such as lamellar meshes, filopodial bundles, and stress fibers. Each of these cytoskeletal structures contains actin filaments and cross-linking proteins, but the role of cross-linking proteins in the initial steps of structure formation has not been clearly elucidated. We employ an optical trapping assay to investigate the behaviors of two actin cross-linking proteins, fascin and α-actinin, during the first steps of structure assembly. Here, we show that these proteins have distinct binding characteristics that cause them to recognize and cross-link filaments that are arranged with specific geometries. α-Actinin is a promiscuous cross-linker, linking filaments over all angles. It retains this flexibility after cross-links are formed, maintaining a connection even when the link is rotated. Conversely, fascin is extremely selective, only cross-linking filaments in a parallel orientation. Surprisingly, bundles formed by either protein are extremely stable, persisting for over 0.5 h in a continuous wash. However, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence decay experiments, we find that the stable fascin population can be rapidly competed away by free fascin. We present a simple avidity model for this cross-link dissociation behavior. Together, these results place constraints on how cytoskeletal structures assemble, organize, and disassemble in vivo.},

However, supporting experimental work is lacking, due in part to hardly accessible molecular length scales. We designed an experiment to directly probe the mechanism of force generation in a setup where a population of actin filaments grows against a load applied by magnetic microparticles. The filaments, arranged in stiff bundles by fascin, are constrained to point toward the applied load. In this protrusion-like geometry, we are able to directly measure the velocity of filament elongation and its dependence on force. Using numerical simulations, we provide evidence that our experimental data are consistent with a Brownian ratchet-based model. We further demonstrate the existence of a force regime far below stalling where the mechanical power transduced by the ratcheting filaments to the load is maximal. The actin machinery in migrating cells may tune the number of filaments at the leading edge to work in this force regime.},

Our computer simulations modeling actin filaments as semiflexible polymers reproduce the experimental observations and provide a model of how actin cross-linkers work with other proteins to regulate actin-filament orientations inside actin bundles and organize the actin network.

	abstract = {Cross-linking proteins can mediate the emergence of rigid bundles from a dense branched network of actin filaments. To enable their binding, the filaments must first bend towards each other. We derive an explicit criterion for the onset of bundling, in terms of the initial length of filaments L, their spacing b, and cross-linker concentration f, reflecting the balance between bending and binding energies. Our model system contains actin, the branching complex Arp2/3 and the bundling protein fascin. In the first distinct stage, during which only actin and Arp2/3 are active, an entangled aster-like mesh of actin filaments is formed. Tens of seconds later, when filaments at the aster periphery are long and barely branched, a sharp transition takes place into a star-like structure, marking the onset of bundling. Now fascin and actin govern bundle growth; Arp2/3 plays no role. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations we calculate the temporal evolution of b and L, and predict the onset of bundling as a function of f. Our predictions are in good qualitative agreement with several new experiments that are reported herein and demonstrate how f controls the aster-star transition and bundle length. We also present two models for aster growth corresponding to different experimental realizations. The first treats filament and bundle association as an irreversible sequence of elongation-association steps. The second, applicable for low f, treats bundling as a reversible self-assembly process, where the optimal bundle size is dictated by the balance between surface and bending energies. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our conclusions for the lamellipodium to filopodia transition in living cells, noting that bundles are more likely nucleated by "tip complex" cross-linkers (e.g. mDia2 or Ena/VASP), whereas fascin is mainly involved in bundle maintenance.},

One challenge is to determine how cells regulate actin assembly and disassembly to carry out these cell behaviors. During Drosophila oogenesis diverse cell behaviors are seen in the soma and germline. We used oogenesis to explore developmental roles of two important actin regulators: Enabled/VASP proteins and Capping protein. We found that Enabled plays an important role in cortical integrity of nurse cells, formation of robust bundled actin filaments in late nurse cells that facilitate nurse cell dumping, and migration of somatic border cells. During nurse cell dumping, Enabled localizes to barbed ends of the nurse cell actin filaments, suggesting its mechanism of action. We further pursued this mechanism using mutant Enabled proteins, each affecting one of its protein domains. These data suggest critical roles for the EVH2 domain and its tetramerization subdomain, while the EVH1 domain appears less critical. Enabled appears to be negatively regulated during oogenesis by Abelson kinase. We also explored the function of Capping protein. This revealed important roles in oocyte determination, nurse cell cortical integrity and nurse cell dumping, and support the idea that Capping protein and Enabled act antagonistically during dumping. Together these data reveal places that these actin regulators shape oogenesis.},

Since actin filaments must be connected to the cell membrane to exert forces but must also detach from the membrane to allow it to move and evolve, the balance between actin filament tethering and detachment at adhesion sites and the leading edge is key for cell shape changes and motility. How this fine tuning is performed in cells remains an open question, but possible candidates are the Drosophila enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) family of proteins, which localize to dynamic actin structures in the cell. Here we study VASP-mediated actin-related proteins 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex-dependent actin dynamics using a substrate that mimics the fluid properties of the cell membrane: an oil-water interface. We show evidence that polymerization activators undergo diffusion and convection on the fluid surface, due to continual attachment and detachment to the actin network. These dynamics are enhanced in the presence of VASP, and we observe cycles of catastrophic detachment of the actin network from the surface, resulting in stop-and-go motion. These results point to a role for VASP in the modulation of filament anchoring, with implications for actin dynamics at cell adhesions and at the leading edge of the cell.},

Other domains of WASp, in particular the proline-rich domain, are required for the formation of actin-rich structures. An in vitro analysis demonstrates that the proline-rich domain of WASp binds VASP with an affinity of approximately 10(6) M(-1). In addition, WASp and VASP both accumulate in actin-rich phagocytic cups. Finally, in a reconstituted motility medium, VASP enhances actin-based propulsion of WASp-coated beads in a fashion reminiscent of its effect on Listeria movement. We propose that VASP and WASp cooperation is essential in stimulating actin assembly and membrane protrusion at the leading edge.},

	abstract = {Intracellular propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes is the best understood form of motility dependent on actin polymerization. We have used in vitro motility assays of Listeria in platelet and brain extracts to elucidate the function of the focal adhesion proteins of the Ena (Drosophila Enabled)/VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) family in actin-based motility. Immunodepletion of VASP from platelet extracts and of Evl (Ena/VASP-like protein) from brain extracts of Mena knockout (-/-) mice combined with add-back of recombinant (bacterial or eukaryotic) VASP and Evl show that VASP, Mena, and Evl play interchangeable roles and are required to transform actin polymerization into active movement and propulsive force. The EVH1 (Ena/VASP homology 1) domain of VASP is in slow association-dissociation equilibrium high-affinity binding to the zyxin-homologous, proline-rich region of ActA. VASP also interacts with F-actin via its COOH-terminal EVH2 domain. Hence VASP/ Ena/Evl link the bacterium to the actin tail, which is required for movement. The affinity of VASP for F-actin is controlled by phosphorylation of serine 157 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Phospho-VASP binds with high affinity (0.5 x 10(8) M-1); dephospho-VASP binds 40-fold less tightly. We propose a molecular ratchet model for insertional polymerization of actin, within which frequent attachment-detachment of VASP to F-actin allows its sliding along the growing filament.},

The myosin motors exert forces on the actin filaments, resulting in a net pulling of the nodes into a contractile ring, while cross-linking interactions help align actin filaments and nodes into a single bundle. We used these mechanisms in a three-dimensional computational model of contractile ring assembly, with semiflexible actin filaments growing from formins at cortical nodes, capturing of filaments by neighboring nodes, and cross-linking among filaments through attractive interactions. The model was used to predict profiles of actin filament density at the cell cortex, morphologies of condensing node-filament networks, and regimes of cortical tension by varying the node pulling force and strength of cross-linking among actin filaments. Results show that cross-linking interactions can lead to confinement of actin filaments at the simulated cortical boundary. We show that the ring-formation region in parameter space lies close to regions leading to clumps, meshworks or double rings, and stars/cables. Since boundaries between regions are not sharp, transient structures that resemble clumps, stars, and meshworks can appear in the process of ring assembly. These results are consistent with prior experiments with mutations in actin-filament turnover regulators, myosin motor activity, and changes in the concentration of cross-linkers that alter the morphology of the condensing network. Transient star shapes appear in some simulations, and these morphologies offer an explanation for star structures observed in prior experimental images. Finally, we quantify tension along actin filaments and forces on nodes during ring assembly and show that the mechanisms describing ring assembly can also drive ring constriction once the ring is formed.},

	abstract = {Background
Formin proteins nucleate actin filaments de novo and stay associated with the growing barbed end. Whereas the formin-homology (FH) 2 domains mediate processive association, the FH1 domains—in concert with the actin-monomer-binding protein profilin—increase the rate of barbed-end elongation. The mechanism by which this effect is achieved is not well understood.

Results
We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to measure the effect of profilin on the elongation of single actin filaments associated with FH1FH2 constructs (derived from the formin Bni1p from S. cerevisiae) with FH1 domains containing one to eight profilin-binding polyproline tracks. Over a large range of profilin concentrations (0.5–25 μM), the rate of barbed-end elongation increases with the number of polyproline tracks in the FH1 domain. The binding of profilin-actin to the FH1 domain is the rate-limiting step (up to rates of at least 88 s−1) in FH1-mediated transfer of actin subunits to the barbed end. Dissociation of formins from barbed ends growing in the presence of profilin is proportional to the elongation rate. Profilin profoundly inhibits nucleation by FH2 and FH1FH2 constructs, but profilin-actin bound to FH1 might contribute weakly to nucleation.

Conclusions
To achieve fast elongation, formin FH1 domains bind profilin-actin complexes and deliver them rapidly to the barbed end associated with the FH2 domain. Because subunit addition promotes dissociation of FH2 domains from growing barbed ends, FH2 domains must pass through a state that is prone to dissociation during each cycle of actin subunit addition coupled to formin translocation.},

	abstract = {Vasodilators such as sodium nitroprusside, nitroglycerin and various prostaglandins are capable of inhibiting platelet aggregation associated with an increase of either cGMP or cAMP. In our studies with intact platelets, prostaglandin E1 and sodium nitroprusside stimulated the phosphorylation of several proteins which could be distinguished from proteins known to be phosphorylated by a calmodulin-regulated protein kinase or by protein kinase C. Prostaglandin E1 (10 microM) or dibutyryl cAMP (2 mM) stimulated the phosphorylation of proteins with apparent relative molecular masses, Mr, of 240,000, 68,000, 50,000, and 22,000 in intact platelets. These proteins were also phosphorylated in response to low concentrations (1-2 microM) of cAMP in a particulate fraction of platelets. In intact platelets, sodium nitroprusside (100 microM) and the 8-bromo derivative of cGMP (2 mM) increased the phosphorylation of one protein of Mr 50,000 which was also phosphorylated in response to low concentrations (1-2 microM) of cGMP in platelet membranes. An additional protein (Mr 24,000) appeared to be phosphorylated to a lesser degree in intact platelets by prostaglandin E1 and sodium nitroprusside. Since the phosphorylation of the protein of Mr 50,000 was stimulated both in intact platelets by cyclic-nucleotide-elevating agents and cyclic nucleotide analogs, as well as in platelet membranes by cyclic nucleotides, this phosphoprotein was analyzed by limited proteolysis, tryptic fingerprinting and phosphoamino acid analysis. These experiments indicated that the 50-kDa proteins phosphorylated by sodium nitroprusside and prostaglandin E1 were identical, and that the peptide of the 50-kDa protein phosphorylated by both agents was also the same as the peptide derived from the 50-kDa protein phosphorylated in platelet membranes by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases, respectively. Regulation of protein phosphorylation mediated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases may be the molecular mechanism by which those vasodilators, capable of increasing either cAMP or cGMP, inhibit platelet aggregation.},

Recent mutation studies have shown that individual crosslinking proteins often play seemingly non-essential roles, leading to the hypothesis that they have considerable redundancy in function. We report live-cell, in vitro, and theoretical studies testing the mechanical role of the two ubiquitous actin-crosslinking proteins, α-actinin and fascin, which co-localize to stress fibers and the basis of filopodia. Using live-cell particle tracking microrheology, we show that the addition of α-actinin and fascin elicits a cell mechanical response that is significantly greater than that originated by α-actinin or fascin alone. These live-cell measurements are supported by quantitative rheological measurements with reconstituted actin filament networks containing pure proteins that show that α-actinin and fascin can work in concert to generate enhanced cell stiffness. Computational simulations using finite element modeling qualitatively reproduce and explain the functional synergy of α-actinin and fascin. These findings highlight the cooperative activity of fascin and α-actinin and provide a strong rationale that an evolutionary advantage might be conferred by the cooperative action of multiple actin-crosslinking proteins with overlapping but non-identical biochemical properties. Thus the combination of structural proteins with similar function can provide the cell with unique properties that are required for biologically optimal responses.},

	abstract = {Short contiguous peptides harboring proline-rich motifs are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions, such as associations with Src homology 3 (SH3) and WW domains. Although patches of aromatic residues present in either domain interact with polyprolines, their overall structures are distinct, suggesting that additional protein families exist that use stacked aromatic amino acids (AA domains) to bind polyproline motifs [1] [2] [3]. A polyproline motif (E/DFPPPPTD/E in the single-letter amino-acid code), present in the ActA protein of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, serves as a ligand for the Ena/VASP protein family --the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), the murine protein Mena, Drosophila Enabled (Ena) and the Ena/VASP-like protein Evl [4] [5] [6] [7]. These share a similar overall structure characterized by the two highly conserved Ena/VASP homology domains (EVH1 and EVH2) [5]. Here, using three independent assays, we have delineated the minimal EVH1 domain. Mutations of aromatic and basic residues within two conserved hydrophilic regions of the EVH1 domain abolished binding to ActA. Binding of an EVH1 mutant with reversed charges could partially be rescued by introducing complementary mutations within the ligand. Like SH3 domains, aromatic residues within the EVH1 domain interacted with polyprolines, whereas the ligand specificity of either domain was determined by reciprocally charged residues. The EVH1 domain is therefore a new addition to the AA domain superfamily, which includes SH3 and WW domains.},

Localization of VASP to the leading edge of a migrating cell can lead to local accumulation of profilin, which in turn can supply actin monomers to growing filament ends. VASP binds to the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and zyxin and this probably directs the phosphoprotein to focal adhesions and the leading edge of stimulated cells. VASP functions as a binding intermediate between profilin and focal adhesion proteins. Intracellular pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, have coat proteins which bind VASP. This is one way in which these pathogens use VASP, and other proteins from the host cell, to assemble the actin filaments they require to move around the cytoplasm of infected cells and enter neighbouring cells. Understanding the role of VASP and other proteins in cell and bacterial motility is likely to lead to development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases including atherosclerosis and tumour growth, and for limiting the spread of intracellular pathogens.},

Mena is abundantly expressed in brain, whereas it is not detectable in platelets and spleen. In intestine and stomach, prominent VASP and Mena immunoreactivity is detected in intestinal smooth muscle cells and blood vessels and cellular membranes of epithelial cells. In kidney, VASP and Mena are abundantly expressed in glomerular mesangial cells and in papilla. VASP and Mena immunoreactivity in heart is associated with blood vessels and with the intercalated discs of cardiac myocytes, where they colocalize with connexin-43. During postnatal development of heart, the level of VASP and Mena expression gradually decreases from neonatal to adult animals. The data demonstrate a clear colocalization of VASP and Mena in cells of stomach, intestine, kidney, and heart.

Together, the two populations formed the three-dimensional structural network seen within expanding lamellipodia. Interaction of the actin filaments with the ventral membrane surface occurred along the length of the filaments via membrane associated proteins. The long bundled filament population was primarily involved in these interactions. The filament tips of either population appeared to interact with the membrane only at the leading edge; this interaction was mediated by a globular Triton-insoluble material. Actin filament polarity was determined by decoration with myosin S1 or heavy meromyosin. Previous reports have suggested that the polarity of the actin filaments in motile cells is uniform, with the barbed ends toward the leading edge. We observed that the actin filament polarity within growth cone lamellipodia is not uniform; although the predominant orientation was with the barbed end toward the leading edge (47-56\%), 22-25\% of the filaments had the opposite orientation with their pointed ends toward the leading edge, and 19-31\% ran parallel to the leading edge. The two actin filament populations display distinct polarity profiles: the longer filaments appear to be oriented predominantly with their barbed ends toward the leading edge, whereas the short filaments appear to be randomly oriented. The different length, organization and polarity of the two filament populations suggest that they differ in stability and function. The population of bundled long filaments, which appeared to be more ventrally located and in contact with membrane proteins, may be more stable than the population of short branched filaments. The location, organization, and polarity of the long bundled filaments suggest that they may be necessary for the expansion of lamellipodia and for the production of tension mediated by receptors to substrate adhesion molecules.},

Filopodia are finger-like extensions of the cell surface that are involved in sensing the environment [1], in attachment of particles for phagocytosis [2], in anchorage of cells on a substratum [3], and in the response to chemoattractants or other guidance cues [4–6]. Filopodia present an excellent model for actin-driven membrane protrusion. They grow at their tips by the assembly of actin and are stabilized along their length by a core of bundled actin filaments. To visualize actin networks in their native membrane-anchored state, filopodia of Dictyostelium cells were subjected to cryo-electron tomography. At the site of actin polymerization, a peculiar structure, the “terminal cone,” is built of short filaments fixed with their distal end to the filopod's tip and with their proximal end to the flank of the filopod. The backbone of the filopodia consists of actin filaments that are shorter than the entire filopod and aligned in parallel or obliquely to the filopod's axis. We hypothesize that growth of the highly dynamic filopodia of Dictyostelium is accompanied by repetitive nucleation of actin polymerization at the filopod tip, followed by the rearrangement of filaments within the shaft.},

	abstract = {Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) proteins are established regulators of actin-based motility, platelet aggregation, and growth cone guidance. However, the molecular mechanisms involved essentially remain elusive. Here we report on a novel mechanism of VASP action, namely the regulation of tensile strength, contractility, and rigidity of the actin cytoskeleton. Compared to wild-type cells fibroblasts derived from VASP-deficient mice have thicker and more stable actin stress fibres. Furthermore focal adhesions are enlarged, myosin light chain phosphorylation is increased, and the rigidity of the filament-supported plasma membrane is elevated about three- to fourfold, as is evident from atomic force microscopy. Moreover, fibronectin-coated beads adhere stronger to the surface of VASP-deficient cells. The resistance of these beads to mechanical displacement by laser tweezers is dramatically increased in an F-actin-dependent mode. Cytoskeletal stabilization coincides with slower cell adhesion and detachment, while overall adhesion is increased. Interestingly, many of these effects observed in VASP (-/-) cells are recapitulated in VASP-overexpressing cells, hinting towards a balanced stoichiometry necessary for appropriate VASP function. Taken together, our results suggest that VASP regulates surface protrusion formation and cell adhesion through modulation of the mechanical properties of the actin cytoskeleton.},

They act by regulating actin-filament geometry, antagonizing the effects of actin-capping protein [5]. Embryos lacking the C. elegans Ena/VASP, UNC-34, display subtle defects in the leading edges of migrating epidermal cells but undergo normal epidermal morphogenesis. In contrast, embryos lacking both UNC-34 and the C. elegans N-WASP homolog have severe defects in epidermal morphogenesis, suggesting that they have parallel roles in coordinating cell behavior. GFP-tagged UNC-34 localizes to the leading edges of migrating epidermal cells, becoming redistributed to new junctions that form during epidermal-sheet sealing. Consistent with this, UNC-34 contributes to the formation of cadherin-based junctions. The junctional localization of UNC-34 is independent of proteins involved in Ena/VASP localization in other experimental systems; instead, junctional distribution depends upon the junctional protein AJM-1. We also show that Abelson tyrosine kinase, a major regulator of Enabled in Drosophila, is not required for UNC-34/Ena function in epithelia. Instead, our data suggest that Abelson kinase acts in parallel to UNC-34/Ena, antagonizing its function.},

	abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is required for many important processes during embryonic development. In later stages of life, important homeostatic processes depend on the actin cytoskeleton, such as immune response, haemostasis and blood vessel preservation. Therefore, the function of the actin cytoskeleton must be tightly regulated, and aberrant regulation may cause disease. A growing number of proteins have been described to bind and regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Amongst them, Ena/VASP proteins function as anti-capping proteins, thereby directly modulating the actin ultrastructure. Ena/VASP function is regulated by their recruitment into protein complexes downstream of plasma membrane receptors and by phosphorylation. As regulators of the actin ultrastructure, Ena/VASP proteins are involved in crucial cellular functions, such as shape change, adhesion, migration and cell-cell interaction and hence are important targets for therapeutic intervention. In this chapter, we will first describe the structure, function and regulation of Ena/VASP proteins. Then, we will review the involvement of Ena/VASP proteins in the development of human diseases. Growing evidence links Ena/VASP proteins to important human diseases, such as thrombosis, cancer, arteriosclerosis, cardiomyopathy and nephritis. Finally, present and future perspectives for the development of therapeutic molecules interfering with Ena/VASP-mediated protein-protein interactions are presented.},

When force is ramped from a low to high value over time, fewer beads detach than with the immediate application of high force. Cells treated with cytochalasin D or lacking Ena/VASP activity show similar levels of detachment relative to controls, but force strengthening is lost. Further, cells overexpressing VASP show stronger adhesion in response to low and high force, but adhesion weakening in response to ramped forces. These results indicate that force-mediated adhesion strengthening occurs in endothelial adherens junctions and that dynamic VASP activity is necessary for this process.},

In this study we suggest that VASP expression may have important role for neural cell migration, differentiation, axonal growth and angiogenesis during prenatal cerebral cortical development. Our aim is to detect VASP expression by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis in developing human neocortex and adult brain cortex (n=12 samples from first, second, and third trimesters and n=3 adult normal cerebral cortex). Our results suggest that VASP showed different immunostaining patterns between cerebral cortical plates in prenatal and adult human brain samples. We observed that the expression patterns of the VASP protein are clearly identified in fibers, cytoplasm of neural cells and endothelial cells of vessels. We detected that VASP indicates progressive expression from the adult brain to second trimester neocortexes. Therefore, we suggest that VASP may play a crucial role in the regulation of human neonatal cerebral cortical development.},

The EVL-knockdown MCF7 cells exhibited a clear reduction in RAD51-foci formation, suggesting that EVL may function in the DSB repair pathway through RAD51-mediated homologous recombination. However, the DSB repair defects were less significant in the EVL-knockdown cells, implying that two EVL paralogues, MENA and VASP, may complement the EVL function in human cells. Therefore, in the present study, we purified human MENA, VASP and EVL as recombinant proteins, and compared their biochemical activities in vitro. We found that all three proteins commonly exhibited the RAD51 binding, DNA binding and DNA-annealing activities. Stimulation of the RAD51-mediated homologous pairing was also observed with all three proteins. In addition, surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that MENA, VASP and EVL mutually interacted. These results support the ideas that the ENA/VASP-family proteins are functionally redundant in homologous recombination, and that all three may be involved in the DSB repair pathway in humans.},

Recombinant His-tagged VASP increased the rate of actin polymerization in the presence of the barbed end cappers, heterodimeric capping protein (CP), CapG, and gelsolin-actin complex. Profilin enhanced the ability of VASP to protect barbed ends from capping by CP, and this required interactions of profilin with G-actin and VASP. The VASP EVH2 domain was sufficient to protect barbed ends from capping, and the F-actin and G-actin binding motifs within EVH2 were required. Phosphorylation by protein kinase A at sites within the VASP EVH2 domain regulated anti-capping and F-actin bundling by VASP. We propose that Ena/VASP proteins associate at or near actin filament barbed ends, promote actin assembly, and restrict the access of barbed end capping proteins.},

Ena/VASP proteins enhance actin filament elongation via the recruitment of profilin:actin complexes to sites of active actin remodelling such as the tips of spreading lamellipodia and the surface of intracellular Listeria. Moreover, Ena/VASP proteins not only enhance actin filament elongation but also influence the activity of the Arp2/3 complex and counteract the inhibition of actin polymerisation by capping proteins.

Though VASP's main activity is the promotion of barbed end growth, it has an F-actin binding site and can form tetramers, and so could additionally play a role in actin crosslinking and bundling in the cell. To test this activity, we performed rheology of reconstituted actin networks in the presence of wild-type VASP or mutants lacking the ability to tetramerize or to bind G-actin and/or F-actin. We show that increasing amounts of wild-type VASP increase network stiffness up to a certain point, beyond which stiffness actually decreases with increasing VASP concentration. The maximum stiffness is 10-fold higher than for pure actin networks. Confocal microscopy shows that VASP forms clustered actin filament bundles, explaining the reduction in network elasticity at high VASP concentration. Removal of the tetramerization site results in significantly reduced bundling and bundle clustering, indicating that VASP's flexible tetrameric structure causes clustering. Removing either the F-actin or the G-actin binding site diminishes VASP's effect on elasticity, but does not eliminate it. Mutating the F-actin and G-actin binding site together, or mutating the F-actin binding site and saturating the G-actin binding site with monomeric actin, eliminates VASP's ability to increase network stiffness. We propose that, in the cell, VASP crosslinking confers only moderate increases in linear network elasticity, and unlike other crosslinkers, VASP's network stiffening activity may be tuned by the local concentration of monomeric actin.},

VASP increases the velocity of beads. VASP increases branch spacing of filaments in the actin tail, as it does in lamellipodia in living cells. The effect of VASP on branch spacing of Arp2/3-induced branched actin arrays is opposed to the effect of capping proteins. However, VASP does not compete with capping proteins for binding barbed ends of actin filaments. VASP enhances branched actin polymerization only when ActA is immobilized on beads or on Listeria. VASP increases the rate of dissociation of the branch junction from immobilized ActA, which is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of site-directed filament branching.},

In vitro, Ena/VASP activities on actin are complex and varied. They promote actin assembly, protect filaments from cappers, bundle filaments, and inhibit filament branching. To determine the mechanisms by which Ena/VASP proteins regulate actin dynamics at barbed ends, we monitored individual actin filaments growing in the presence of VASP and profilin using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Filament growth was unchanged by VASP, but filaments grew faster in profilin-actin and VASP than with profilin-actin alone. Actin filaments were captured directly by VASP-coated surfaces via interactions with growing barbed ends. End-attached filaments transiently paused but resumed growth after becoming bound to the surface via a filament side attachment. Thus, Ena/VASP proteins promote actin assembly by interacting directly with actin filament barbed ends, recruiting profilin-actin, and blocking capping.},

Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia protruded slower but more persistently, consistent with their increased cell translocation rates. Actin networks in Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia contained shorter, more highly branched filaments compared to controls. Lamellipodia with excess Ena/VASP contained longer, less branched filaments.

We show that glia-maturation factor (GMF), which is an Arp2/3 complex inhibitor and actin filament debranching factor [9, 10], regulates lamellipodial protrusion dynamics in living cells. In cultured S2R(+) cells, GMF silencing resulted in an increase in the width of lamellipodial actin filament arrays. Importantly, live-cell imaging of mutant Drosophila egg chambers revealed that the dynamics of actin-rich protrusions in migrating border cells is diminished in the absence of GMF. Consequently, velocity of border cell clusters undergoing guided migration was reduced in GMF mutant flies. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrated that GMF cooperates with the Drosophila homolog of Aip1 (flare) in promoting disassembly of Arp2/3-nucleated actin filament networks and driving border cell migration. These data suggest that GMF functions in vivo to promote the disassembly of Arp2/3-nucleated actin filament arrays, making an important contribution to cell migration within a 3D tissue environment.},

Various mathematical models have been proposed to explain how cells convert chemical energy released upon actin polymerization into a pushing force on a surface. These models have attempted to explain puzzling properties of actin-based motility, including persistent attachment of the network to the membrane during propulsion and the interesting trajectories of propelled particles. These models fall generally into two classes: those requiring filament (+)-ends to fluctuate freely from the membrane to add subunits, and those where filaments elongate with their (+)-ends persistently associated with surface through filament end-tracking proteins (“actoclampin” models). This review compares and contrasts the key predictions of these two classes of models with regard to force–velocity profiles, and evaluates them with respect to experiments with biomimetic particles, and the experimental evidence on the role of end-tracking proteins such as formins and nucleation-promoting factors in actin-based motility.},

APC localizes in vivo to microtubule plus ends and actin-rich cortical protrusions, and has well-documented direct effects on microtubule dynamics. However, its potential effects on actin dynamics have remained elusive. Here, we show that the C-terminal "basic" domain of APC (APC-B) potently nucleates the formation of actin filaments in vitro and stimulates actin assembly in cells. Nucleation is achieved by a mechanism involving APC-B dimerization and recruitment of multiple actin monomers. Further, APC-B nucleation activity is synergistic with its in vivo binding partner, the formin mDia1. Together, APC-B and mDia1 overcome a dual cellular barrier to actin assembly imposed by profilin and capping protein. These observations define a new function for APC and support an emerging view of collaboration between distinct actin assembly-promoting factors with complementary activities.},

Each filopodium contains a rigid and organized bundle of parallel actin filaments, which are elongated at filopodial tips by formins and Ena/VASP proteins [ 5–10 ]. However, relatively little is known about how the actin filaments in the filopodial shaft are spatially organized to form a bundle with appropriate dimensions and mechanical properties. Here, we report that the mammalian formin Daam1 (Disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1) is a potent actin-bundling protein and localizes all along the filopodial shaft, which differs from other formins that localize specifically to the tips. Silencing of Daam1 led to severe defects in filopodial number, integrity, and architecture, similar to silencing of the bundling protein fascin. This led us to investigate the potential relationship between Daam1 and fascin. Fascin and Daam1 coimmunoprecipitated from cell extracts, and silencing of fascin led to a striking loss of Daam1 localization to filopodial shafts, but not tips. Furthermore, purified fascin bound directly to Daam1, and multicolor single-molecule TIRF imaging revealed that fascin recruited Daam1 to and stabilized Daam1 on actin bundles in vitro. Our results reveal an unanticipated and direct collaboration between Daam1 and fascin in bundling actin, which is required for proper filopodial formation.},

Small forces on the filaments dramatically slowed formin-mediated polymerization in the absence of profilin, but resulted in faster polymerization in the presence of profilin. We propose that force shifts the conformational equilibrium of the end of a filament associated with formin homology 2 domains toward the closed state that precludes polymerization, but that profilin-actin associated with formin homology 1 domains reverses this effect. Thus, physical forces strongly influence actin assembly by formin Bni1p.},

Lamellipodial protrusion is powered by actin polymerization, which is mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)-induced nucleation of branched actin networks and the elongation of actin filaments. Recently, advances have been made in our understanding of positive and negative ARP2/3 regulators (such as the SCAR/WAVE (SCAR/WASP family verprolin-homologous protein) complex and Arpin, respectively) and of proteins that control actin branch stability (such as glial maturation factor (GMF)) or actin filament elongation (such as ENA/VASP proteins) in lamellipodium dynamics and cell migration. This Review highlights how the balance between actin filament branching and elongation, and between the positive and negative feedback loops that regulate these activities, determines lamellipodial persistence. Importantly, directional persistence, which results from lamellipodial persistence, emerges as a critical factor in steering cell migration.},

In recent years GTPase regulation of formins has been extensively studied, but other molecular mechanisms that determine subcellular distribution or regulate formin activity have remained poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that the activity and localization of mouse formin mDia1 can be regulated through interactions with phospholipids. The phospholipid-binding sites of mDia1 are clusters of positively charged residues in the N-terminal basic domain (BD) and at the C-terminal region. Upon binding to the lipid bilayer the N-terminal region of mDia1 induces strong clustering of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) and subsequently inserts into the membrane bilayer thus anchoring mDia1 to the reconstituted plasma membrane. In addition, an interaction of phospholipids with the C-terminal region of mDia1 causes a drastic reduction of its actin filament assembly activity. Our data suggest that the N-terminal phospholipid-binding sites help to anchor formins at the plasma membrane, and the interaction with phospholipids in the C-terminus functions as a switch for transient inactivation.},

The sequence of elementary reactions that describe filament assembly from profilin-actin at either free or formin-bound barbed ends is not fully understood. Specifically, the identity of the transitory complexes between profilin and actin terminal subunits is not known; and whether ATP hydrolysis is directly or indirectly coupled to profilin-actin assembly is not clear. We have analyzed the effect of profilin on actin assembly at free and FH1-FH2-bound barbed ends in the presence of ADP and non-hydrolyzable CrATP. Profilin blocked filament growth by capping the barbed ends in ADP and CrATP/ADP-Pi states, with a higher affinity when formin is bound. We confirm that, in contrast, profilin accelerates depolymerization of ADP-F-actin, more efficiently when FH1-FH2 is bound to barbed ends. To reconcile these data with effective barbed end assembly from profilin-MgATP-actin, the nature of nucleotide bound to both terminal and subterminal subunits must be considered. All data are accounted for quantitatively by a model in which a barbed end whose two terminal subunits consist of profilin-ATP-actin cannot grow until ATP has been hydrolyzed and Pi released from the penultimate subunit, thus promoting the release of profilin and allowing further elongation. Formin does not change the activity of profilin but simply uses it for its processive walk at barbed ends. Finally, if profilin release from actin is prevented by a chemical cross-link, formin processivity is abolished.},

The dynamic nature of the actin polymer is modulated to facilitate specific cellular processes at discrete locations by actin-binding proteins (ABPs), including the formins and tropomyosins (Tms). Formins nucleate actin polymers, while Tms are conserved dimeric proteins that form polymers along the length of actin filaments. Cells possess different Tm isoforms, each capable of differentially regulating the dynamic and functional properties of the actin polymer. However, the mechanism by which a particular Tm localizes to a specific actin polymer is unknown. Here we show that specific formin family members dictate which Tm isoform will associate with a particular actin filament to modulate its dynamic and functional properties at specific cellular locations. Exchanging the localization of the fission yeast formins For3 and Cdc12 results in an exchange in localizations of Tm forms on actin polymers. This nucleator-driven switch in filament composition is reflected in a switch in actin dynamics, together with a corresponding change in the filament's ability to regulate ABPs and myosin motor activity. These data establish a role for formins in dictating which specific Tm variant will associate with a growing actin filament and therefore specify the functional capacity of the actin filaments that they create.},

Signalling pathways such as tyrosine kinases, stretch-activated Ca(2+) channels and Rho GTPases are involved in force sensing. However, how signals are transduced to actin assembly remains obscure. Here we show mechanosensitive actin polymerization by formins (formin homology proteins). Cells overexpressing mDia1 increased the amount of F-actin on release of cell tension. Fluorescence single-molecule speckle microscopy revealed rapid induction of processive actin assembly by mDia1 on cell cortex deformation. mDia1 lacking the Rho-binding domain and other formins exhibited mechanosensitive actin nucleation, suggesting Rho-independent activation. Mechanosensitive actin nucleation by mDia1 required neither Ca(2+) nor kinase signalling. Overexpressing LIM kinase abrogated the induction of processive mDia1. Furthermore, s-FDAPplus (sequential fluorescence decay after photoactivation) analysis revealed a rapid actin monomer increase on cell cortex deformation. Our direct visualization of the molecular behaviour reveals a mechanosensitive actin filament regeneration mechanism in which G-actin released by actin remodelling plays a pivotal role.},

Here, we show that Arp2/3 localized to only a minor portion of the protrusion. Moreover, treatment of L. monocytogenes-infected HeLa cells with a formin FH2-domain inhibitor significantly reduced protrusion length. In addition, the Diaphanous-related formins 1-3 (mDia1-3) localized to protrusions, and knockdown of mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3 substantially decreased cell-to-cell spread of L. monocytogenes.

In this study, we explored possible roles and the signaling pathway involved for mDia1 using a mouse oocyte model. mDia1 depletion reduced polar body extrusion, which may have been due to reduced cortical actin assembly. mDia1 and Profilin1 had similar localization patterns in mouse oocytes and mDia1 knockdown resulted in reduced Profilin1 expression. Depleting FMNL1, another Formin family member, resulted in reduced mDia1 expression, while RhoA inhibition did not alter mDia1 expression, which indicated that there was a FMNL1-mDia1-Profilin1 signaling pathway in mouse oocytes. Additionally, mDia1 knockdown resulted in disrupting oocyte spindle morphology, which was confirmed by aberrant p-MAPK localization.

Mutations of two formin residues contributing to these interactions (R1423N, K1467L, or both) reduced the interaction energies between the proteins, and in coarse-grained simulations, the formin lost more interprotein contacts with an actin dimer than with an actin 7-mer.

We found that two distinct domains within Capu, FH2 and tail, work together to promote high-affinity microtubule binding. The tail domain appears to bind microtubules through nonspecific charge-based interactions. In contrast, distinct residues within the FH2 domain are important for microtubule binding. We also report the first visualization of a formin polymerizing actin filaments in the presence of microtubules. Interestingly, microtubules are potent inhibitors of the actin nucleation activity of Capu but appear to have little effect on Capu once it is bound to the barbed end of an elongating filament. Because Capu does not simultaneously bind microtubules and assemble actin filaments in vitro, its actin assembly and microtubule binding activities likely require spatial and/or temporal regulation within the Drosophila oocyte.},

Here we characterize Fmn2 and elucidate the molecular mechanism for this synergy, using bulk solution and individual filament kinetic measurements of actin assembly dynamics. We show that by capping filament barbed ends, Spire recruits Fmn2 and facilitates its association with barbed ends, followed by rapid processive assembly and release of Spire. In the presence of actin, profilin, Spire, and Fmn2, filaments display alternating phases of rapid processive assembly and arrested growth, driven by a "ping-pong" mechanism, in which Spire and Fmn2 alternately kick off each other from the barbed ends. The results are validated by the effects of injection of Spire, Fmn2, and their interacting moieties in mouse oocytes. This original mechanism of regulation of a Rho-GTPase-independent formin, recruited by Spire at Rab11a-positive vesicles, supports a model for modulation of a dynamic actin-vesicle meshwork in the oocyte at the origin of asymmetric positioning of the meiotic spindle.},

Despite the crucial role of actin polymerization for the survival of the malaria parasite, the majority of Plasmodium cellular actin is present in the monomeric form. Plasmodium lacks most of the canonical actin nucleators, and formins are essentially the only candidates for this function in all Apicomplexa. The malaria parasite has two formins, containing conserved formin homology (FH) 2 and rudimentary FH1 domains. Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum formin 1 associates with and nucleates both mammalian and Plasmodium actin filaments. Although Plasmodium profilin alone sequesters actin monomers, thus inhibiting polymerization, its monomer-sequestering activity does not compete with the nucleating activity of formin 1 at an equimolar profilin-actin ratio.

Via PTEN, formin also localized to the cell apex, phragmoplast, and to the cell cortex as dynamic cortical spots. We show that the cortical localization driven by binding to PI(3,5)P(2) was required for function. Silencing the kinases that produce PI(3,5)P(2) reduced cortical targeting of formin and inhibited polarized growth. We show a subset of cortical formin spots moved in actin-dependent linear trajectories. We observed that the linearly moving subpopulation of cortical formin generated new actin filaments de novo and along preexisting filaments, providing evidence for formin-mediated actin bundling in vivo.

	abstract = {INF2 (inverted formin 2) is a formin protein with unusual biochemical characteristics. As with other formins, the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain of INF2 accelerates actin filament assembly and remains at the barbed end, modulating elongation. The unique feature of INF2 is its ability to sever filaments and enhance depolymerization, which requires the C-terminal region. Physiologically, INF2 acts in the secretory pathway and is mutated in two human diseases, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In this study, we investigate the effects of mutating two FH2 residues found to be key in other formins: Ile-643 and Lys-792. Surprisingly, neither mutation abolishes barbed end binding, as judged by pyrene-actin and total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy elongation assays. The I643A mutation causes tight capping of a subset of filaments, whereas K792A causes slow elongation of all filaments. The I643A mutation has a minor inhibitory effect on polymerization activity but causes almost complete abolition of severing and depolymerization activity. The K792A mutation has relatively small effects on polymerization, severing, and depolymerization. In cells, the K792A mutant causes actin accumulation around the endoplasmic reticulum to a similar extent as wild type, whereas the I643A mutant causes no measurable polymerization. The inability of I643A to induce actin polymerization in cells is explained by its inability to promote robust actin polymerization in the presence of capping protein. These results highlight an important point: it is dangerous to assume that mutation of conserved FH2 residues will have equivalent effects in all formins. The work also suggests that both mutations have effects on the mechanism of processive elongation.},

Many formin proteins are regulated by an autoinhibition mechanism involving intramolecular binding of a Diaphanous inhibitory domain and a Diaphanous autoregulatory domain. However, the activation mechanism for these Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) is not completely understood. Although small GTPases play an important role in relieving autoinhibition, other factors likely contribute. Here we describe a requirement for the septin Shs1 and the septin-associated kinase Gin4 for the localization and in vivo activity of the budding yeast DRF Bnr1. In budding yeast strains in which the other formin, Bni1, is conditionally inactivated, the loss of Gin4 or Shs1 results in the loss of actin cables and cell death, similar to the loss of Bnr1. The defects in these strains can be suppressed by constitutive activation of Bnr1. Gin4 is involved in both the localization and activation of Bnr1, whereas the septin Shs1 is required for Bnr1 activation but not its localization. Gin4 promotes the activity of Bnr1 independently of the Gin4 kinase activity, and Gin4 lacking its kinase domain binds to the critical localization region of Bnr1.

Significant questions remain unanswered regarding the molecular mechanism of actin nucleation and elongation stimulated by each formin isovariant, and how the different isovariants coordinate to regulate actin dynamics in cells. Here, we characterize a class II formin, AtFH19, biochemically. We found that AtFH19 retains all general properties of the formin family, including nucleation and barbed end capping activity. It can also generate actin filaments from a pool of actin monomers bound to profilin. However, both the nucleation and barbed end capping activities of AtFH19 are less efficient compared to those of another well-characterized formin, AtFH1. Interestingly, AtFH19 FH1FH2 competes with AtFH1 FH1FH2 in binding actin filament barbed ends, and inhibits the effect of AtFH1 FH1FH2 on actin. We thus propose a mechanism in which two quantitatively different formins coordinate to regulate actin dynamics by competing for actin filament barbed ends.},

In addition, INF2 binds actin monomers through its diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) that resembles a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) sequence C-terminal to the FH2 that participates in both polymerization and depolymerization. INF2-DAD is also predicted to participate in an autoinhibitory interaction with the N-terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID). In this work, we show that actin monomer binding to the DAD of INF2 competes with the DID/DAD interaction, thereby activating actin polymerization. INF2 is autoinhibited in cells because mutation of a key DID residue results in constitutive INF2 activity. In contrast, purified full-length INF2 is constitutively active in biochemical actin polymerization assays containing only INF2 and actin monomers. Addition of proteins that compete with INF2-DAD for actin binding (profilin or the WH2 from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) decrease full-length INF2 activity while not significantly decreasing activity of an INF2 construct lacking the DID sequence. Profilin-mediated INF2 inhibition is relieved by an anti-N-terminal antibody for INF2 that blocks the DID/DAD interaction. These results suggest that free actin monomers can serve as INF2 activators by competing with the DID/DAD interaction. We also find that, in contrast to past results, the DID-containing N terminus of INF2 does not directly bind the Rho GTPase Cdc42.},

	abstract = {Formin proteins direct the nucleation and assembly of linear actin filaments in a variety of cellular processes using their conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain. Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) are effectors of Rho-family GTPases, and in the absence of Rho activation they are maintained in an inactive state by intramolecular interactions between their regulatory N-terminal region and a C-terminal segment referred to as the DAD domain. Although structures are available for the isolated DAD segment in complex with the interacting region in the N-terminus, it remains unclear how this leads to inhibition of actin assembly by the FH2 domain. Here we describe the crystal structure of the N-terminal regulatory region of formin mDia1 in complex with a C-terminal fragment containing both the FH2 and DAD domains. In the crystal structure and in solution, these fragments form a tetrameric complex composed of two interlocking N+C dimers. Formation of the tetramer is likely a consequence of the particular N-terminal construct employed, as we show that a nearly full-length mDia1 protein is dimeric, as are other autoinhibited N+C complexes containing longer N-terminal fragments. The structure provides the first view of the intact C-terminus of a DRF, revealing the relationship of the DAD to the FH2 domain. Delineation of alternative dimeric N+C interactions within the tetramer provides two general models for autoinhibition in intact formins. In both models, engagement of the DAD by the N-terminus is incompatible with actin filament formation on the FH2, and in one model the actin binding surfaces of the FH2 domain are directly blocked by the N-terminus.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formin proteins utilize a conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain to nucleate new actin filaments. In mammalian diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) the FH2 domain is inhibited through an unknown mechanism by intramolecular binding of the diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD) and the diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID).
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report the crystal structure of a complex between DID and FH2-DAD fragments of the mammalian DRF, mDia1 (mammalian diaphanous 1 also called Drf1 or p140mDia). The structure shows a tetrameric configuration (4 FH2 + 4 DID) in which the actin-binding sites on the FH2 domain are sterically occluded. However biochemical data suggest the full-length mDia1 is a dimer in solution (2 FH2 + 2 DID). Based on the crystal structure, we have generated possible dimer models and found that architectures of all of these models are incompatible with binding to actin filament but not to actin monomer. Furthermore, we show that the minimal functional monomeric unit in the FH2 domain, termed the bridge element, can be inhibited by isolated monomeric DID. NMR data on the bridge-DID system revealed that at least one of the two actin-binding sites on the bridge element is accessible to actin monomer in the inhibited state.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that autoinhibition in the native DRF dimer involves steric hindrance with the actin filament. Although the structure of a full-length DRF would be required for clarification of the presented models, our work here provides the first structural insights into the mechanism of the DRF autoinhibition.},

All other nucleators are known to recruit actin monomers as a central part of their mechanisms. However, the actin-nucleating FH2 domain of formins lacks appreciable affinity for monomeric actin. Here, we found that yeast and mammalian formins bind actin monomers but that this activity requires their C-terminal DAD domains. Furthermore, we observed that the DAD works in concert with the FH2 to enhance nucleation without affecting the rate of filament elongation. We dissected this mechanism in mDia1, mapped nucleation activity to conserved residues in the DAD, and demonstrated that DAD roles in nucleation and autoinhibition are separable. Furthermore, DAD enhancement of nucleation was independent of contributions from the FH1 domain to nucleation. Together, our data show that (1) the DAD has dual functions in autoinhibition and nucleation; (2) the FH1, FH2, and DAD form a tripartite nucleation machine; and (3) formins nucleate by recruiting actin monomers and therefore are more similar to other nucleators than previously thought.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate that mDia2 is phosphorylated by ROCK (Rho-kinase) at two conserved residues (Thr(1061) and Ser(1070)) just C-terminal to the DAD basic region. Phosphomimetic mutations to these residues in the context of the full-length molecule enhanced mDia2 activity as measured by increased actin polymerization, SRF (serum response factor)-dependent smooth muscle-specific gene transcription, and nuclear localization of myocardin-related transcription factor B. Biochemical and functional data indicate that the T1061E/S1070E mutation significantly inhibited the ability of DAD to interact with DID and enhanced mDia2 activation by RhoA.

In vivo analysis of smy1Δ mutants demonstrates that this "damper" mechanism is critical for maintaining proper actin cable architecture, dynamics, and function. We directly observe Smy1-3GFP being transported by myosin V and transiently pausing at the neck in a manner dependent on Bnr1.

In cells lacking the clathrin-binding adaptor proteins Ent1, Ent2, Yap1801, and Yap1802, we identify a second endocytic pathway that depends on the GTPase Rho1, the downstream formin Bni1, and the Bni1 cofactors Bud6 and Spa2. This second pathway does not require components of the better-studied endocytic pathway, including clathrin and Arp2/3 complex activators. Thus, our results reveal the existence of a second pathway for endocytosis in yeast, which suggests similarities with the RhoA-dependent endocytic pathways of mammalian cells.},

Budding yeast's two formins, Bni1p and Bnr1p, assemble actin cables necessary for polarized cell growth and organelle segregation. Here we define four regions in Bni1p that contribute to its localization to the bud and at the bud neck. The first (residues 1-333) requires dimerization for its localization and encompasses the Rho-binding domain. The second (residues 334-821) covers the Diaphanous inhibitory-dimerization-coiled coil domains, and the third is the Spa2p-binding domain. The fourth region encompasses the formin homology 1-formin homology 2-COOH region of the protein. These four regions can each localize to the bud cortex and bud neck at the right stage of the cell cycle independent of both F-actin and endogenous Bni1p. The first three regions contribute cumulatively to the proper localization of Bni1p, as revealed by the effects of progressive loss of these regions on the actin cytoskeleton and fidelity of spindle orientation. The fourth region contributes to the localization of Bni1p in tiny budded cells. Expression of mislocalized Bni1p constructs has a dominant-negative effect on both growth and nuclear segregation due to mislocalized actin assembly.

The flexible Formin Homology 1 (FH1) domain, located directly N-terminal to the FH2 domain, contains one or more stretches of polyproline that bind the actin-binding protein profilin. Diffusion of FH1 domains brings associated profilin-actin complexes into contact with the FH2-bound barbed end of the filament, thereby enabling direct transfer of actin. We investigated how the organization of the FH1 domain of budding yeast formin Bni1p determines the rates of profilin-actin transfer onto the end of the filament. Each FH1 domain transfers actin to the barbed end independently of the other and structural evidence suggests a preference for actin delivery from each FH1 domain to the closest long-pitch helix of the filament. The transfer reaction is diffusion-limited and influenced by the affinities of the FH1 polyproline tracks for profilin. Position-specific sequence variations optimize the efficiency of FH1-stimulated polymerization by binding profilin weakly near the FH2 domain and binding profilin more strongly farther away. FH1 domains of many other formins follow this organizational trend. This particular sequence architecture may optimize the efficiency of FH1-stimulated elongation.},

Despite relatively unperturbed adhesion dynamics and force transmission, impaired stress fiber assembly impeded focal adhesion compositional maturation and fibronectin remodeling. Finally, we show that compositional maturation of focal adhesions could occur even when myosin II-dependent cellular tension was reduced by 80\%. We propose that stress fiber assembly at the adhesion site serves as a structural template that facilitates adhesion maturation over a wide range of tensions.

In vitro, both DAAM fragments catalyze actin nucleation but severely decrease both the elongation and depolymerization rate of the filaments. Profilin acts as a molecular switch in DAAM function.

It has been suggested that mDias preferentially recruit actin complexed to profilin due to their proline-rich FH1 domains. During filament elongation, dimeric mDias remain attached to the barbed ends by their FH2 domains, which form an anti-parallel ring-like structure enclosing the filament barbed ends. Dimer formation of mDia-FH2 domains is dependent on their N-terminal lasso and linker subdomains (connector). Here, we investigated the effect of isolated FH2 domains on actin polymerization using mDia1-FH2 domain plus connector, as well as core mDia1, mDia2, and mDia3 missing the connector, by cosedimentation and electron microscopy after negative staining. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that core FH2 domains of mDia1 and mDia2 exhibited a low degree of dimer formation, whereas mDia3-FH2 minus connector and mDia1-FH2 plus connector readily dimerized. Only core mDia3-FH2 was able to nucleate actin polymerization. However, all tested core FH2 domains decorated and bundled F-actin, as demonstrated by electron microscopy after negative staining. Bundling activity was highest for mDia3-FH2, decreased for mDia2-FH2, and further decreased for mDia1-FH2. The mDia1-FH2 domain plus connector induced actin polymerization also in the absence of profilin, but failed to induce F-actin deformation and bundling. We also tested whether mDia1-FH2 was able to repolymerize actin in complex with different proteins that stabilize globular actin. The data obtained demonstrated that mDia1-FH2 induced actin repolymerization only from the actin/cofilin-1 complex, but not when complexed to actin depolymerizing factor, gelsolin segment 1, vitamin D binding protein, or deoxyribonuclease I.},

The 3.4-Å structure of a mouse FMNL3 FH2 dimer in complex with tetramethylrhodamine-actin uncovers details of formin-regulated actin elongation. We observe distinct FH2 actin-binding regions; interactions in the knob and coiled-coil subdomains are necessary for actin binding, whereas those in the lasso-post interface are important for the stepping mechanism. Biochemical and cellular experiments test the importance of individual residues for function. This structure provides details for FH2-mediated filament elongation by processive capping and supports a model in which C-terminal non-FH2 residues of FMNL3 are required to stabilize the filament nucleus.},

Here, we define the cellular localization of endogenous FMNL3, the dynamics of GFP-tagged FMNL3 during cell migration, and the effects of FMNL3 suppression in mammalian culture cells. The majority of FMNL3 localizes in a punctate pattern, with over 95\% of these puncta being indistinguishable from the plasma membrane by fluorescence microscopy. A small number of dynamic cytoplasmic FMNL3 patches also exist, which enrich near cell-cell contact sites and fuse with the plasma membrane at these sites. These cytoplasmic puncta appear to be part of larger membranes of endocytic origin. On the plasma membrane, FMNL3 enriches particularly in filopodia, membrane ruffles, and at nascent cell-cell adhesions. FMNL3-containing filopodia occur both at the cell-substratum interface and at cell-cell contacts, with the latter being 10-fold more stable. FMNL3 suppression by siRNA has two major effects: a decrease in filopodia, and compromised cell-cell adhesion in cells migrating as a sheet. Overall, our results suggest that FMNL3 functions in assembly of actin-based protrusions that are specialized for cell-cell adhesion.},

The lack of a fluorescent actin probe has prevented a detailed study of actin filament dynamics in contractile rings, and left open questions regarding the mechanism of cytokinesis. To incorporate fluorescent actin into the contractile ring to study its dynamics, we introduced the coding sequence for a tetracysteine motif (FLNCCPGCCMEP) at 10 locations in the fission yeast actin gene and expressed the mutant proteins from the native actin locus in diploid cells with wild-type actin on the other chromosome. We labeled these tagged actins inside live cells with the FlAsH reagent. Cells incorporated some of these labeled actins into actin patches at sites of endocytosis, where Arp2/3 complex nucleates all of the actin filaments. However, the cells did not incorporate any of the FlAsH-actins into the contractile ring. Therefore, formin Cdc12p rejects actin subunits with a tag of {\textasciitilde}2 kDa, illustrating the stringent structural requirements for this formin to promote the elongation of actin filament barbed ends as it moves processively along the end of a growing filament.},

We show that mDia1 is mechanosensitive and that the elongation rate of filaments is increased up to two-fold by the application of a pulling force. We also show that mDia1 is able to track a depolymerizing barbed end in spite of an opposing pulling force, which means that mDia1 can efficiently put actin filaments under mechanical tension.

However, compared with knowledge of how nucleation of dendritic actin filament arrays by the actin-related protein-2/3 complex is regulated, the in vivo regulatory mechanisms for actin cable formation are less clear. To gain insights into mechanisms for regulating actin cable assembly, we reconstituted the assembly process in vitro by introducing microspheres functionalized with the C terminus of the budding yeast formin Bni1 into extracts prepared from yeast cells at different cell-cycle stages. EM studies showed that unbranched actin filament bundles were reconstituted successfully in the yeast extracts. Only extracts enriched in the mitotic cyclin Clb2 were competent for actin cable assembly, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity was indispensible. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity also was found to regulate cable assembly in vivo. Here we present evidence that formin cell-cycle regulation is conserved in vertebrates. The use of the cable-reconstitution system to test roles for the key actin-binding proteins tropomyosin, capping protein, and cofilin provided important insights into assembly regulation. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry, we identified components of the actin cables formed in yeast extracts, providing the basis for comprehensive understanding of cable assembly and regulation.},

In budding yeast, formins stimulate the assembly of an organized network of actin cables that direct polarized secretion.

A mutant lacking the C-terminal half of Hof1 displays misoriented and architecturally altered cables, along with impaired secretory vesicle traffic. In vitro, Hof1 inhibits the actin nucleation and elongation activities of Bnr1 without displacing the formin from filament ends. These effects depend on the Src homology 3 domain of Hof1, the formin homology 1 (FH1) domain of Bnr1, and Hof1 dimerization, suggesting a mechanism by which Hof1 "restrains" the otherwise flexible FH1-FH2 apparatus. In vivo, loss of inhibition does not alter actin levels in cables but, instead, cable shape and functionality. Thus Hof1 tunes formins to sculpt the actin cable network.},

This process seems to be important for cell migration, embryonic development, wound healing, and pathogenic infection pathways. We have shown that filopodial tips are able to sense adhesive contact and, as a consequence, locally reduce actin polymerization speed. This induces filopodial retraction via forces generated by the cell membrane tension and by the filopodial actin shaft that is constantly pulled rearwards via the retrograde flow of actin at the base. The tip is also the weakest point of actin-based force transduction. Forces higher than 15 pN can disconnect the actin shaft from the membrane, which increases actin polymerization at the tip. Together, this points toward the tip as a mechano-chemical sensing and steering unit for filopodia, and it calls for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved.},

Under resting conditions, DRFs are auto-inhibited by an intra-molecular interaction between the C-terminal and the N-terminal domains. The auto-inhibition is thought to be released by binding of an activated RhoGTPase to the N-terminal GTPase-binding domain (GBD).

We used evanescent wave fluorescence microscopy to observe assembly of actin filaments (i) nucleated by soluble formin FH1FH2 domains and (ii) associated with formin FH1FH2 domains immobilized on microscope slides. Bni1p(FH1FH2)p and Cdc12p(FH1FH2)p nucleated new actin filaments or captured the barbed ends of preformed actin filaments that grew by insertion of subunits between the immobilized formin and the barbed end of the filament. Both formins remained bound to growing actin filament barbed ends for {\textgreater}1,000 sec. Elongation of a filament between an immobilized formin and a second anchor point buckled filament segments as short as 0.7 microm, demonstrating that polymerization of single actin filaments produces forces of {\textgreater}1 piconewton, close to the theoretical maximum. After buckling, further growth produced long loops that did not supercoil, suggesting that formins do not stair step along the two subunits exposed on the growing barbed end. In agreement, Arp2/3 complex branched filaments did not rotate as they grew from formins attached to the slide surface. Formins are not mechanistically identical because barbed end elongation from Cdc12(FH1FH2)p, but not Bni1(FH1FH2)p, requires profilin. However, profilin increased the rate of Bni1(FH1FH2)p-mediated barbed end elongation from 75\% to 100\% of full-speed.},

In direct comparison to the well-studied Cdc12, we report the first in vitro characterization of the actin-assembly properties of For3 and Fus1. All three share fundamental formin activities; however, particular reaction rates vary significantly. Cdc12 is an efficient nucleator (one filament per approximately 3 Cdc12 dimers) that processively elongates profilin-actin at a moderate rate of 10 subunits s(-1) μM(-1), but lacks filament-bundling activity. Fus1 is also an efficient nucleator, yet processively elongates profilin-actin at one-half the rate of and dissociates 10-fold more rapidly than Cdc12; it also bundles filaments. For3 nucleates filaments 100-fold less well than Fus1, but like Cdc12, processively elongates profilin-actin at a moderate rate and lacks filament-bundling activity. Additionally, both the formin homology FH1 and FH2 domains contribute to the overall rate of profilin-actin elongation.

This review focuses on understanding how mechanical stress applied to an actin filament can affect its assembly dynamics. Today, experiments addressing this issue at the scale of individual actin filaments are emerging and bring novel insight into mechanotransduction. For instance, recent data show that actin filaments can act as mechanosensors, as an applied tension or curvature alters their conformation and their affinity for regulatory proteins. Filaments can also transmit mechanical tension to other proteins, which consequently change the way they interact with the filaments to regulate their assembly. These results provide evidence for mechanotransduction at the scale of individual filaments, showing that forces participate in the regulation of filament assembly and organization. They bring insight into the elementary events coupling mechanics and biochemistry in cells. The experiments presented here are linked to recent technical developments, and certainly announce the advent of more exciting results in the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formins are a conserved family of actin nucleators responsible for the assembly of diverse actin structures such as cytokinetic rings and filopodia. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the formin for3p is necessary for the formation of actin cables, which are bundles of short parallel actin filaments that regulate cell polarity. These filaments are largely organized with their barbed ends facing the cell tip, where for3p is thought to function in their assembly.
RESULTS: Here, using a functional for3p-3GFP fusion expressed at endogenous levels, we find that for3p localizes to small dots that appear transiently at cell tips and then move away on actin cables at a rate of 0.3 microm/s. These movements were dependent on the continuous assembly of actin in cables, on the ability of for3p to bind actin within its FH2 domain, and on profilin and bud6p, two formin binding proteins that promote formin activity. Bud6p transiently colocalizes with for3p at the cell tip and stays behind at the cell tip when for3p detaches.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a new model for actin cable assembly: a for3p particle is activated and promotes the assembly of a short actin filament at the cell tip for only seconds. For3p and the actin filament may then be released from the cell tip and carried passively into the cell interior by retrograde flow of actin filaments in the cable. These studies reveal a complex and dynamic cycle of formin regulation and actin cable assembly in vivo.},

	abstract = {Proper centrosome separation is a prerequisite for positioning the bipolar spindle. Although studies demonstrate that microtubules (MTs) and their associated motors drive centrosome separation [1], the role of actin in centrosome separation remains less clear. Studies in tissue culture cells indicate that actin- and myosin-based cortical flow is primarily responsible for driving late centrosome separation [2], whereas other studies suggest that actin plays a more passive role by serving as an attachment site for astral MTs to pull centrosomes apart [3-6]. Here we demonstrate that prior to nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) in Drosophila embryos, proper centrosome separation does not require myosin II but requires dynamic actin rearrangements at the growing edge of the interphase cap. Both Arp2/3- and Formin-mediated actin remodeling are required for separating the centrosome pairs before NEB. The Apc2-Armadillo complex appears to link cap expansion to centrosome separation. In contrast, the mechanisms driving centrosome separation after NEB are independent of the actin cytoskeleton and compensate for earlier separation defects. Our studies show that the dynamics of actin polymerization drive centrosome separation, and this has important implications for centrosome positioning during processes such as cell migration [7, 8], cell polarity maintenance [9, 10], and asymmetric cell division [11, 12].},

We used analytical and computational modeling to test the validity and implications of the proposed coupled For3p/actin mechanism. We compared the model to prior experiments quantitatively and generated predictions for the expected behavior of the actin cable system upon changes of parameter values. We found that the model generates stable steady states with realistic values of rate constants and actin and For3p concentrations. Comparison of our results to previous experiments monitoring the FRAP of For3p-3GFP and the response of actin cables to treatments with actin depolymerizing drugs provided further support for the model. We identified the set of parameter values that produces results in agreement with experimental observations. We discuss future experiments that will help test the model's predictions and eliminate other possible mechanisms.

	abstract = {Matrix adhesions provide critical signals for cell growth or differentiation. They form through a number of distinct steps that follow integrin binding to matrix ligands. In an early step, integrins form clusters that support actin polymerization by an unknown mechanism. This raises the question of how actin polymerization occurs at the integrin clusters. We report here that a major formin in mouse fibroblasts, FHOD1, is recruited to integrin clusters, resulting in actin assembly. Using cell-spreading assays on lipid bilayers, solid substrates, and high-resolution force-sensing pillar arrays, we find that knockdown of FHOD1 impairs spreading, coordinated application of adhesive force, and adhesion maturation. Finally, we show that targeting of FHOD1 to the integrin sites depends on the direct interaction with Src family kinases and is upstream of the activation by Rho kinase. Thus, our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of cell migration with implications for development and disease.},

	abstract = {Formin homology proteins (formins) are responsible for the formation of actin structures such as actin stress fibers, actin cables, and cytokinetic contractile rings. Formins are the major actin filament (F-actin) nucleators in the cell. Because formins remain bound to the barbed end after nucleating an actin filament, it was expected that formins might rotate along the double-helical structure of F-actin during processive actin elongation (helical rotation). Here, we describe a method to detect the rotational movement of F-actin elongating from immobilized formins using single-molecule fluorescence polarization (FLP). Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) attached to Cys-374 of actin emits polarized fluorescence at ≈ 45° with respect to the filament axis. When the TMR-labeled F-actin laying at 45° in the visual field rotates, the vertical- and horizontal-polarized fluorescence (FLV and FLH, respectively) of TMR alternately become bright. This technique allowed us to demonstrate the helical rotation of mDia1, a mammalian formin. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis in actin subunits is not required for helical rotation; however, ATP appears to contribute to accelerating actin elongation by mDia1. When helical rotation is limited by trapping both mDia1 and the pointed-end side, the processive filament elongation is blocked. Thus, mDia1 faithfully rotates along the long-pitch helix of F-actin. In this chapter, we introduce the theoretical concept of single-molecule FLP, the optical setup, the preparation of adenosine diphosphate-bound actin, and the procedure to observe the rotational movement of F-actin elongating from immobilized formins.},

	abstract = {Cells contain multiple formin isoforms that drive the assembly of profilin-actin for diverse processes. Given that many organisms also contain several profilin isoforms, specific formin/profilin pairs might be matched to optimally stimulate actin polymerization. We utilized a combination of bulk actin polymerization and single filament total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy assays to measure the effect of different profilin isoforms on the actin assembly properties of the cytokinesis formins from fission yeast (Cdc12p) and the nematode worm (CYK-1). We discovered that Cdc12p only effectively utilizes the single fission yeast profilin isoform SpPRF. Conversely, CYK-1 prefers the essential worm cytokinesis profilin CePFN-1 to the two non-essential worm profilin isoforms (SpPRF = CePFN-1 {\textgreater} CePFN-2 {\textgreater} CePFN-3). Chimeras containing the profilin-binding formin homology 1 (FH1) domain from one formin and the barbed-end associated FH2 domain from the other formin, revealed that both the FH1 and FH2 domains help confer profilin isoform specialization. Although the Cdc12p and CYK-1 FH1 domains cannot differentiate between profilin isoforms in the absence of actin, formin FH1 domains appear to preferentially select specific isoforms of profilin-actin. Surprisingly, analysis of profilin point mutants revealed that differences in highly conserved residues in both the poly-L-proline and actin binding regions of profilin do not explain their differential utilization by formin. Therefore, rapid formin-mediated elongation of profilin-actin depends upon favorable interactions of profilin-actin with the FH1 domain as well as the barbed-end associated FH2 domain. Specific formin FH1FH2 domains are tailored to optimally utilize actin bound to particular profilin isoforms.},

We demonstrated helical rotation of the formin mDia1 by single-molecule fluorescence polarization (FL(P)). FL(P) of labeled F-actin, both elongating and depolymerizing from immobilized mDia1, oscillated with a periodicity corresponding to that of the F-actin long-pitch helix, and this was not altered by actin-bound nucleotides or the actin-binding protein profilin. Thus, helical rotation is an intrinsic property of formins. To harness pushing forces from growing F-actin, formins must be anchored flexibly to cell structures.},

	abstract = {Formins are multidomain proteins that assemble actin in a wide variety of biological processes. They both nucleate and remain processively associated with growing filaments, in some cases accelerating filament growth. The well conserved formin homology 1 and 2 domains were originally thought to be solely responsible for these activities. Recently a role in nucleation was identified for the Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD), which is C-terminal to the formin homology 2 domain. The C-terminal tail of the Drosophila formin Cappuccino (Capu) is conserved among FMN formins but distinct from other formins. It does not have a DAD domain. Nevertheless, we find that Capu-tail plays a role in filament nucleation similar to that described for mDia1 and other formins. Building on this, replacement of Capu-tail with DADs from other formins tunes nucleation activity. Capu-tail has low-affinity interactions with both actin monomers and filaments. Removal of the tail reduces actin filament binding and bundling. Furthermore, when the tail is removed, we find that processivity is compromised. Despite decreased processivity, the elongation rate of filaments is unchanged. Again, replacement of Capu-tail with DADs from other formins tunes the processive association with the barbed end, indicating that this is a general role for formin tails. Our data show a role for the Capu-tail domain in assembling the actin cytoskeleton, largely mediated by electrostatic interactions. Because of its multifunctionality, the formin tail is a candidate for regulation by other proteins during cytoskeletal rearrangements.},

We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe directly individual actin filament polymerization in the presence of two mammalian formins (mDia1 and mDia2) and two yeast formins (Bni1p and Cdc12p). We show that these diverse formins have the same basic properties: movement is processive in the absence or presence of profilin; profilin accelerates elongation; and actin ATP hydrolysis is not required for processivity.

In agreement with previous experiments discussed below, we find an optimal profilin concentration with a maximal elongation rate that can exceed the rate of actin alone. High profilin concentrations suppress elongation, largely because free profilin displaces profilin-actin from FH1. The model supports a common polymerization mechanism for the four formin FH1FH2 constructs with differences attributed to varying parameter values.

Subunit exchange kinetics were analyzed by both a treadmill model and an exchange-diffusion model. The best fit to a treadmill model of the data obtained in 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ATP at 30 degrees C gave a treadmill efficiency (net monomers incorporated per ATP hydrolyzed) of 0.26, in good agreement with the previously reported s-value of 0.25 (Wegner, A. (1976) J. Mol. Biol. 108, 139-150) for similar ionic conditions. However, in this and other conditions with excess free divalent cations (Ca2+ or Mg2+), the observed exchange kinetics were in better agreement with an exchange-diffusion model than with a treadmilling model over the entire time course of the experiment. In the absence of excess divalent cations (50 mM KCl), exchange was too slow to be analyzed adequately by either model. Using the measured filament length distribution and the observed fit of the exchange-diffusion model to the data in 0.5 mM MgCl2, an on-rate constant of 2.8 x 10(6) M-1 S-1 and an off-rate constant of 5.8 s-1 were calculated. These values, while in good agreement with previously measured pre-steady state polymerization rate constants under different ionic conditions (Pollard, T. D., and Mooseker, M. S. (1981) J. Cell Biol. 88, 654-659), are about 30-fold higher than the rate constants predicted from the rate of ATP hydrolysis at steady state.

We also found that VASP interacted with Abi-1 both in vitro and in vivo. VASP was tyrosine-phosphorylated in Bcr-Abl-positive leukaemic cells in an Abi-1-dependent manner. Co-expression of c-Abl and Abi-1 or the phosphomimetic Y39D mutation in VASP resulted in less accumulation of VASP at focal adhesions. VASP Y39D had a reduced affinity to the proline-rich region of zyxin. Interestingly, overexpression of both phosphomimetic and unphosphorylated forms of VASP, but not wild-type VASP, impaired adhesion of K562 cells to fibronectin. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle of VASP by the Abi-1-bridged mechanism regulates association of VASP with focal adhesions, which may regulate adhesion of Bcr-Abl-transformed leukaemic cells.},

VASP localizes to regions of dynamic actin reorganization such as the focal adhesion contacts, the leading edge or filopodia, where it contributes to F-actin filament elongation. Here we identify VASP as a novel substrate for protein kinase D1 (PKD1). We show that PKD1 directly phosphorylates VASP at two serine residues, Ser-157 and Ser-322. These phosphorylations occur in response to RhoA activation and mediate VASP re-localization from focal contacts to the leading edge region. The net result of this PKD1-mediated phosphorylation switch in VASP is increased filopodia formation and length at the leading edge. However, such signaling when persistent induced membrane ruffling and decreased cell motility.},

Examination of the molecular kinetics of the various FA constituents, using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP), in the absence of or following short-term treatment with the drug, revealed major changes in the kon and koff values of the different proteins tested, which are in close agreement with their differential dissociation rates from the adhesion sites.

Here we report that in human platelets spread on glass, VASP is associated predominantly with the distal parts of radial microfilament bundles and with microfilaments outlining the periphery, whereas less VASP is associated with a central microfilamentous ring. VASP is also detectable in a variety of different cell types including fibroblasts and epithelial cells. In fibroblasts, VASP is concentrated at focal contact areas, along microfilament bundles (stress fibres) in a punctate pattern, in the periphery of protruding lamellae, and is phosphorylated by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases in response to appropriate stimuli. Evidence for the direct binding of VASP to F-actin is also presented.

Interactions of cadherins with the actin cytoskeleton are essential for providing both stability and plasticity to adherens junctions.

In turn, actin regulates cadherin turnover by regulating its endocytosis and actomyosin networks exert forces driving remodeling of cell-cell contacts.

FAs are made of a multiprotein complex, the adhesome, which connects integrins to stress fibers made of mixed-polarity actin filaments [ 1–5 ]. Myosin II-driven contraction of stress fibers generates tensile forces that promote adhesion growth [ 6–9 ]. However, tension must be tightly controlled, because if released, FAs disassemble [ 3, 10–12 ]. Conversely, excess tension can cause abrupt cell detachment resulting in the loss of a major part of the adhesion [ 9, 12 ]. Thus, both adhesion growth and disassembly depend on tensile forces generated by stress fiber contraction, but how this contractility is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that the actin-bundling protein fascin crosslinks the actin filaments into parallel bundles at the stress fibers’ termini. Fascin prevents myosin II entry at this region and inhibits its activity in vitro. In fascin-depleted cells, polymerization of actin filaments at the stress fiber termini is slower, the actin cytoskeleton is reorganized into thicker stress fibers with a higher number of myosin II molecules, FAs are larger and less dynamic, and consequently, traction forces that cells exert on their substrate are larger. We also show that fascin dissociation from stress fibers is required to allow their severing by cofilin, leading to efficient disassembly of FAs.},

	abstract = {The spontaneous and unregulated polymerization of actin filaments is inhibited in cells by actin monomer-binding proteins such as profilin and Tβ4. Eukaryotic cells and certain pathogens use filament nucleators to stabilize actin polymerization nuclei, whose formation is rate-limiting. Known filament nucleators include the Arp2/3 complex and its large family of nucleation promoting factors (NPFs), formins, Spire, Cobl, VopL/VopF, TARP and Lmod. These molecules control the time and location for polymerization, and additionally influence the structures of the actin networks that they generate. Filament nucleators are generally unrelated, but with the exception of formins they all use the WASP-Homology 2 domain (WH2 or W), a small and versatile actin-binding motif, for interaction with actin. A common architecture, found in Spire, Cobl and VopL/VopF, consists of tandem W domains that bind three to four actin subunits to form a nucleus. Structural considerations suggest that NPFs–Arp2/3 complex can also be viewed as a specialized form of tandem W-based nucleator. Formins are unique in that they use the formin-homology 2 (FH2) domain for interaction with actin and promote not only nucleation, but also processive barbed end elongation. In contrast, the elongation function among W-based nucleators has been “outsourced” to a dedicated family of proteins, Eva/VASP, which are related to WASP-family NPFs.},

The transition between two forms of actin, monomeric or G-actin and filamentous or F-actin, is tightly regulated in time and space by a large number of signaling, scaffolding and actin-binding proteins (ABPs). New ABPs are constantly being discovered in the post-genomic era. Most of these proteins are modular, integrating actin binding, protein-protein interaction, membrane-binding, and signaling domains. In response to extracellular signals, often mediated by Rho family GTPases, ABPs control different steps of actin cytoskeleton assembly, including filament nucleation, elongation, severing, capping, and depolymerization. This review summarizes structure-function relationships among ABPs in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton assembly.},

However, these techniques are either experimentally cumbersome or applicable to a limited set of experimental systems. We present a new type of surface-generated structured illumination fluorescence microscopy, variable incidence angle fluorescence interference contrast microscopy (VIA-FLIC), in which the fluorescent sample is assembled above a reflective Si surface and the incidence angle of excitation light is varied by placing annular photomasks with different radii in the aperture diaphragm plane of the microscope. The variation in incidence angle alters the interference pattern of excitation light, and hence the intensity of detected fluorescence. Quantitative VIA-FLIC is tested by using a set of fluorophore-containing supported membranes separated from the Si surface by SiO2 layers of variable thicknesses. The resulting fluorescence intensity versus incidence angle curves depends on the separation from the Si surface and when fit with an appropriate model yield precise SiO2 thicknesses that are accurate with respect to the known SiO2 thicknesses. Since only a simple modification to a standard epifluorescence microscope is required, VIA-FLIC offers a versatile method to produce z-reconstructions with high resolution for a wide range of biological systems.},

Despite some overlap in the phenotype and neuropathology of FTLD-FUS and ALS-FUS, significant differences of potential pathomechanistic relevance were recently identified in the protein composition of inclusions in these conditions. While ALS-FUS showed only accumulation of FUS, inclusions in FTLD-FUS revealed co-accumulation of all members of the FET protein family, that include FUS, Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) and TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15 (TAF15) suggesting a more complex disturbance of transportin-mediated nuclear import of proteins in FTLD-FUS compared to ALS-FUS. To gain more insight into the mechanisms of inclusion body formation, we investigated the role of Transportin 1 (Trn1) as well as 13 additional cargo proteins of Transportin in the spectrum of FUS-opathies by immunohistochemistry and biochemically. FUS-positive inclusions in six ALS-FUS cases including four different mutations did not label for Trn1. In sharp contrast, the FET-positive pathology in all FTLD-FUS subtypes was also strongly labeled for Trn1 and often associated with a reduction in the normal nuclear staining of Trn1 in inclusion bearing cells, while no biochemical changes of Trn1 were detectable in FTLD-FUS. Notably, despite the dramatic changes in the subcellular distribution of Trn1 in FTLD-FUS, alterations of its cargo proteins were restricted to FET proteins and no changes in the normal physiological staining of 13 additional Trn1 targets, such as hnRNPA1, PAPBN1 and Sam68, were observed in FTLD-FUS. These data imply a specific dysfunction in the interaction between Trn1 and FET proteins in the inclusion body formation in FTLD-FUS. Moreover, the absence of Trn1 in ALS-FUS provides further evidence that ALS-FUS and FTLD-FUS have different underlying pathomechanisms.},

Unlike HLA classical class I gene products, MICA does not present any antigen but acts as a ligand for several immune cells including natural killer (NK) cells bearing NKG2D receptors. MICA is the member of the non-classical class I family that displays the greatest degree of polymorphism. MICA alleles can be divided into two large groups with the polymorphisms found in α3 domains. This division could be explained by a possible polyphyletic origin that is in line with recent findings from evolutionary, population and functional studies of this gene. MICA polymorphisms are associated with a number of diseases related to NK activity, such as viral infection, cancer and allograft rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The mechanisms underlying these associations include NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and MICA shedding to produce immunosuppressive soluble MICA particles. The MICA-induced humoral response has attracted interest recently because of its possible role in graft rejection in solid organ transplantation. Here, we discuss the genetics and biology of the MICA gene and its products, and their importance in disease.},

In North American Caucasians, MICA*00801 (*008/A5.1) accounted for 42\% of the genes and was the most common allele. We observed a high degree of linkage disequilibrium between certain alleles of MICA and of HLA-B in the South American Indian populations.

	abstract = {Immune recognition mediated by the activating receptor NKG2D plays an important role for the elimination of stressed cells, including tumors and virus-infected cells. On the other hand, the ligands for NKG2D can also be shed into the sera of cancer patients where they weaken the immune response by downmodulating the receptor on effector cells, mainly NK and T cells. Although both families of NKG2D-ligands, major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain (MIC) A/B and UL16 binding proteins (ULBPs), are related to MHC molecules and their expression is increased after stress, many differences are observed in terms of their biochemical properties and cell trafficking. In this paper, we summarize the variety of NKG2D-ligands and propose that selection pressure has driven evolution of diversity in their trafficking and shedding, but not receptor binding affinity. However, it is also possible to identify functional properties common to individual ULBP molecules and MICA/B alleles, but not generally conserved within the MIC or ULBP families. These characteristics likely represent examples of convergent evolution for efficient immune recognition, but are also attractive targets for pathogen immune evasion strategies. Categorization of NKG2D-ligands according to their biological features, rather than their genetic family, may help to achieve a better understanding of NKG2D-ligand association with disease.},

The binding groove of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class is essentially important for antigen binding and presentation on T cells. There are several molecules that have analogous conformations to class I MHC. However, they bind specifically to varying types of ligands and cell-surface receptors in order to elicit an immune response. To elucidate how such recognition is achieved in classical MHC-I like molecules, we have extensively analyzed the structure of human leukocyte antigen (HLA-1), neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1), gamma delta T cell receptor ligand (Τ22), zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), and MHC class I chain-related (MIC-A) proteins. All these molecules have analogous structural anatomy, divided into three distinct domains, where α1−α2 superdomains form a groove-like structure that potentially bind to certain ligand, while the α3 domain adopts a fold resembling immunoglobulin constant domains, and holds this α1−α2 platform and the light chain. We have observed many remarkable features of α1−α2 platform, which provide specificities to these proteins toward a particular class of ligands. The relative orientation of α1, α2, and α3 domains is primarily responsible for the specificity to the light chain. Interestingly, light chain of all these proteins is β2-microglobulin (β2M), except ZAG which has prolactin-induced protein (PIP). However, MIC-A is devoid of any light chain. Residues on β2M recognize a sequence motif on the α3 domain that is essentially restricted to specific heavy chain of MHC class I molecules. Our analysis suggests that the structural features of class I molecules determine the recognition of different ligands and light chains, which are responsible for their corresponding functions through an inherent mechanism.},

Individual Ena tetramers increase the elongation rate approximately two- to threefold and inhibit capping protein by remaining processively associated with the barbed end for an average of ∼10 s in solution, for ∼60 s when immobilized on a surface, and for ∼110 s when multiple Ena tetramers are clustered on a surface. Ena also can gather and simultaneously elongate multiple barbed ends. Collectively, these properties could facilitate the recruitment of Fascin and initiate filopodia formation. Remarkably, we found that Ena’s actin-assembly properties are tunable on Fascin-bundled filaments, facilitating the formation of filopodia-like F-actin networks without tapered barbed ends. Ena-associated trailing barbed ends in Fascin-bundled actin filaments have approximately twofold more frequent and approximately fivefold longer processive runs, allowing them to catch up with leading barbed ends efficiently. Therefore, Fascin and Ena cooperate to extend and maintain robust filopodia of uniform thickness with aligned barbed ends by a unique mechanistic cycle.},

Ena/VASP proteins regulate the actin cytoskeleton during cell migration and morphogenesis and promote assembly of both filopodial and lamellipodial actin networks. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying their cellular functions we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to visualize VASP tetramers interacting with static and growing actin filaments in vitro. We observed multiple filament binding modes: (1) static side binding, (2) side binding with one-dimensional diffusion, and (3) processive barbed end tracking. Actin monomers antagonize side binding but promote high affinity (Kd = 9 nM) barbed end attachment. In low ionic strength buffers, VASP tetramers are weakly processive (Koff = 0.69 s−1) polymerases that deliver multiple actin monomers per barbed end–binding event and effectively antagonize filament capping. In higher ionic strength buffers, VASP requires profilin for effective polymerase and anti-capping activity. Based on our observations, we propose a mechanism that accounts for all three binding modes and provides a model for how VASP promotes actin filament assembly.},

	abstract = {Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in cells is tightly regulated by a vast number of actin-binding proteins (ABPs). These proteins interact with actin via a limited set of conserved folding motifs. One of the most abundant actin-binding motifs is the beta-thymosin fold, represented by the prototypical actin-monomer sequestering protein thymosin-beta4. Among many cytoskeletal proteins, the beta-thymosin fold adopts a shorter form, known as the WASP homology domain 2. Some characteristic features of the beta-thymosin/WH2 fold include its small size (17-43 aa), significant sequence and length variability, frequent occurrence in the form of tandem repeats, and remarkable multifunctionality. This paper discusses the relationship between structure and function of the beta-thymosin/WH2 fold on the basis of four examples: (1) actin monomer sequestration (thymosin-beta4), (2) actin filament nucleation (WASP-Arp2/3 complex, Lmod, and spire), (3) actin filament elongation (Ena/VASP), and (4) cytoskeleton scaffolding (IRSp53 and MIM). Although the core function of the beta-thymosin/WH2 domain in all these proteins is actin binding, specific changes in the sequence of the domain and modular organization of the proteins in which it is found give rise to diverse functions in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics.},

The molecular bases of this process are poorly understood. Here we present structural and energetic evidence for two consecutive steps of the elongation mechanism: the recruitment of profilin-actin by the last poly-Pro segment of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and the binding of profilin-actin simultaneously to this poly-Pro and to the G-actin-binding (GAB) domain of VASP.

	abstract = {Although structural, biochemical, and genetic studies have provided much insight into the determinants of specificity and affinity of proteins for RNA, little is currently known about the kinetics that underlie RNA–protein interactions. Protein–RNA complexes are dynamic, and the kinetics of binding and release could influence many processes, such as the ability of RNA–binding proteins to compete for binding sites, the sequential assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and the ability of bound RNA to move between cellular compartments. Therefore, to attain a complete and biologically relevant understanding of RNA–protein interactions, complex formation must be studied not only in equilibrated reactions, but also as a dynamic process. BIACORE, a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor technology, allows intermolecular interactions to be measured in real time, and can provide both equilibrium and kinetic information about complex formation. This technology is a powerful tool with which to study the dynamics of RNA–protein interactions. We have used BIACORE extensively to obtain detailed insight into the interaction between RNA and proteins carrying RNA recognition motif domains. Here we discuss the physical principles on which BIACORE is based, and the required instrumentation. We describe how to design well-controlled RNA–protein interaction experiments aimed at yielding high-quality data, and outline the steps required for data analysis. In addition, we present examples to illustrate how kinetic studies have provided us with unique insights into the interaction of the spliceosomal U1A protein and the neuronal HuD protein with their respective RNA targets.},

To function properly, these organelles constantly communicate with the surrounding cellular compartments. This communication includes the import of proteins, the exchange of metabolites and ions, and interactions with other organelles, all of which heavily depend on membrane proteins localized to the outer envelope membranes. Therefore, correct and efficient targeting of these membrane proteins, which are encoded by the nuclear genome and translated in the cytosol, is critically important for organellar function.

In vitro nuclear transport using permeabilized cells indicated that nuclear import of DNS is mediated by transportin-1 (Trn-1). DNS accumulation in the nucleus was dependent on Trn-1, Ran, and energy in multiple rounds of nuclear transport. Use of DNS with deletions, alanine scanning mutagenesis and point mutations revealed that two separate regions (the N-terminal seven residues and the C-terminal two residues) are crucial for in vivo and in vitro transport as well as for interaction with Trn-1. The N- and C-terminal motifs are conserved in the shuttling sequences of hnRNP A1 and JKTBP.},

The reduction and alkylation step was introduced since experiments with lysozyme and ribonuclease A showed that extremely complex peptide patterns were obtained if no precautions were taken to suppress disulfide bond formation during in-gel digestion of proteins. The advantage of this method is that no blotting step is required for generating internal sequences and that extensive proteolysis occurs which closely resembles that resulting from solution digests.

Transient complexes, which are characterized by high dissociation constants, are typically lost by this approach. In the present study, we describe a novel method for identifying transient protein-protein interactions using in vivo cross-linking and MS-based protein identification. Live cells are treated with formaldehyde, which rapidly permeates the cell membrane and generates protein-protein cross-links. Proteins cross-linked to a Myc-tagged protein of interest are copurified by immunoaffinity chromatography and subjected to a procedure which dissociates the cross-linked complexes. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins are identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Application of this method enabled the identification of numerous proteins that copurified with a constitutively active form of M-Ras (M-Ras(Q71L)). Among these, we identified the RasGAP-related protein IQGAP1 to be a novel interaction partner of M-Ras(Q71L).

Here we report the development and application of an orthogonal cross-linking chemistry specific for carboxyl groups. Chemical cross-linking of acidic residues is achieved using homobifunctional dihydrazides as cross-linking reagents and a coupling chemistry at neutral pH that is compatible with the structural integrity of most protein complexes. In addition to cross-links formed through insertion of the dihydrazides with different spacer lengths, zero-length cross-link products are also obtained, thereby providing additional structural information. We demonstrate the application of the reaction and the MS identification of the resulting cross-linked peptides for the chaperonin TRiC/CCT and the 26S proteasome. The results indicate that the targeting of acidic residues for cross-linking provides distance restraints that are complementary and orthogonal to those obtained from lysine cross-linking, thereby expanding the yield of structural information that can be obtained from cross-linking studies and used in hybrid modeling approaches.},

Due to its small size, formaldehyde can readily permeate cell walls and membranes, resulting in efficient cross-linking, i.e. the formation of covalent bonds between proteins, DNA, and other reactive molecules. Indeed, formaldehyde cross-linking is an instrumental component of many mainstream analytical/cell biology techniques including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of protein-DNA complexes found in nuclei; immunohistological analysis of protein expression and localization within cells, tissues, and organs; and mass spectrometry (MS)-compatible silver-staining methodologies used to visualize low abundance proteins in polyacrylamide gels. However, despite its exquisite suitability for use in the analysis of protein environments within cells, formaldehyde has yet to be commonly employed in the directed analysis of protein–protein interactions and cellular networks. The general purpose of this article is to discuss recent advancements in the use of formaldehyde cross-linking in combination with MS-based methodologies. Key advantages and limitations to the use of formaldehyde over other cross-linkers and technologies currently used to study protein–protein interactions are highlighted, and formaldehyde-based experimental approaches that are proving very promising in their ability to accurately and efficiently identify novel protein–protein and multiprotein interaction complexes are presented.

Here, we provide an overview of workflows that incorporate immunoaffinity purifications and quantitative mass spectrometry (frequently abbreviated as IP-MS or AP-MS) for characterizing protein-protein interactions. We discuss experimental aspects that should be considered when optimizing the isolation of a protein complex. As the presence of nonspecific associations is a concern in these experiments, we discuss the common sources of nonspecific interactions and present label-free and metabolic labeling mass spectrometry-based methods that can help determine the specificity of interactions. The effective regulation of cellular pathways and the rapid reaction to various environmental stresses rely on the formation of stable, transient, and fast-exchanging protein-protein interactions.

Karyopherinβ2 (Kapβ2) or transportin imports numerous RNA binding proteins into the nucleus. Kapβ2 binds substrates in the cytoplasm and targets them through the nuclear pore complex, where RanGTP dissociates them in the nucleus. Here we report the 3.0 Å crystal structure of unliganded Kapβ2, which consists of a superhelix of 20 HEAT repeats. Together with previously reported structures of NLS and Ran complexes, this structure provides understanding of conformational heterogeneity that accompanies ligand binding. The Kapβ2 superhelix is divided into three major segments. Two of them (HEAT repeats 9–13 and 14–18), which constitute the substrate binding site, are rigid elements that rotate relative to each other about a flexible hinge. The third (HEAT repeats 1–8), which constitutes the Ran binding site, exhibits conformational changes throughout its length. An analogous segmental architecture is also observed in Importinβ, suggesting that it is functionally significant and may be conserved in other import karyopherins.},

Here we present the 3.0 Å structure of the karyopherin-2–RanGppNHp complex where GppNHp is a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue. Karyopherin-2 contains eighteen HEAT repeats arranged into two continuous orthogonal arches. Ran is clamped in the amino-terminal arch and substrate-binding activity is mapped to the carboxy-terminal arch. A large loop in HEAT repeat 7 spans both arches. Interactions of the loop with Ran and the C-terminal arch implicate it in GTPase-mediated dissociation of the import-substrate. RanGppNHp in the complex shows extensive structural rearrangement, compared to RanGDP, in regions contacting karyopherin-2. This provides a structural basis for the specificity of the karyopherin- family for the GTP-bound state of Ran, as well as a rationale for interactions of the karyopherin–Ran complex with the regulatory proteins ranGAP, ranGEF and ranBP1.},

Karyopherinβ (Kapβ) proteins bind nuclear localization and export signals (NLSs and NESs) to mediate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, a process regulated by Ran GTPase through its nucleotide cycle. Diversity and complexity of signals recognized by Kapβs have prevented prediction of new Kapβ substrates. The structure of Kapβ2 (also known as Transportin) bound to one of its substrates, the NLS of hnRNP A1, that we report here explains the mechanism of substrate displacement by Ran GTPase. Further analyses reveal three rules for NLS recognition by Kapβ2: NLSs are structurally disordered in free substrates, have overall basic character, and possess a central hydrophobic or basic motif followed by a C-terminal R/H/KX(2-5)PY consensus sequence. We demonstrate the predictive nature of these rules by identifying NLSs in seven previously known Kapβ2 substrates and uncovering 81 new candidate substrates, confirming five experimentally. These studies define and validate a new NLS that could not be predicted by primary sequence analysis alone.},

Most methyltransferases use the methyl donor, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), as a cofactor. Current methyltransferase inhibitors display limited specificity, indiscriminately targeting all enzymes that use AdoMet. In this screen we have identified a primary compound, AMI-1, that specifically inhibits arginine, but not lysine, methyltransferase activity in vitro and does not compete for the AdoMet binding site. Furthermore, AMI-1 prevents in vivo arginine methylation of cellular proteins and can modulate nuclear receptor-regulated transcription from estrogen and androgen response elements, thus operating as a brake on certain hormone actions.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) associate with pre-mRNA in the nucleus and play an important role in RNA processing and splice site selection. In addition, hnRNP A proteins function in the export of mRNA to the cytoplasm. Although the hnRNP A proteins are predominantly nuclear, hnRNP A1 shuttles rapidly between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. HnRNP A2, whose cytoplasmic overexpression has been identified as an early biomarker of lung cancer, has been less well studied. Cytosolic hnRNP A2 overexpression has also been noted in brain tumors, in which it has been correlated with translational repression of Glucose Transporter-1 expression. We now examine the role of arginine methylation on the nucleocytoplasmic localization of hnRNP A2 in the HEK-293 and NIH-3T3 mammalian cell lines. Treatment of either cell line with the methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde dramatically shifts hnRNP A2 localization from the nuclear to the cytoplasmic compartment, as shown both by immunoblotting and by immunocytochemistry. In vitro radiolabeling with [3H]AdoMet of GST-tagged hnRNP A2 RGG mutants, using recombinant protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT1), shows (i) that hnRNP A2 is a substrate for PRMT1 and (ii) that methylated residues are found only in the RGG domain. Deletion of the RGG domain (R191-G253) of hnRNP A2 results in a cytoplasmic localization phenotype, detected both by immunoblotting and by immunocytochemistry. These studies indicate that the RGG domain of hnRNP A2 contains sequences critical for cellular localization of the protein. The data suggest that hnRNP A2 may contain a novel nuclear localization sequence, regulated by arginine methylation, that lies in the R191-G253 region and may function independently of the M9 transportin-1-binding region in hnRNP A2.},

In its C-terminal domain, the protein carries 13 arginine residues that are all asymmetrically dimethylated. The function of this modification in PABPN1 has been unknown. Part of the methylated domain serves as nuclear localization signal, binding the import receptor transportin. Here we report that arginine methylation weakens the affinity of PABPN1 for transportin. Recombinant, unmethylated PABPN1 binds more strongly to transportin than its methylated counterpart from mammalian tissue, and in vitro methylation reduces the affinity. Transportin and RNA compete for binding to PABPN1. Methylation favors RNA binding. Transportin also inhibits in vitro methylation of the protein. Finally, a peptide corresponding to the nuclear localization signal of PABPN1 competes with transportin-dependent nuclear import of the protein in a permeabilized cell assay and does so less efficiently when it is methylated. We hypothesize that transportin binding might delay methylation of PABPN1 until after nuclear import. In the nucleus, arginine methylation may favor the transition of PABPN1 to the competing ligand RNA and serve to reduce the risk of the protein being reexported to the cytoplasm by transportin.},

We established an in vitro system using digitonin-permeabilized cells to analyze nuclear import of c-Fos in detail. Two import receptors of the importin beta superfamily, importin beta itself and transportin, promote import of c-Fos in vitro. Under conditions where importin beta-dependent transport was blocked, c-Fos still accumulated in the nucleus in the presence of cytosol. Inhibition of the transportin-dependent pathway, in contrast, abolished import of c-Fos. Furthermore, c-Fos mutants that interact with transportin but not with importin beta were efficiently imported in the presence of cytosol. Hence, transportin appears to be the predominant import receptor for c-Fos. A detailed biochemical characterization revealed that the interaction of transportin with c-Fos is distinct from the interaction with its established import cargoes, the M9 sequence of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 or the nuclear localization sequence of some basic proteins. Likewise, the binding sites on importin beta for its classic import cargo and for c-Fos can be separated. In summary, c-Fos employs a novel mode of receptor-cargo interaction. Hence, transportin may be as versatile as importin beta in recognizing different nuclear import cargoes.},

Importin-β1 is the paradigm of karyopherins and, together with its cargo-adapter importin-α, mediates the general nuclear import pathway. Here we show the existence of different cellular pools of both importin-α and -β1 homologues, KapA and KapB, in the coenocytic ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans. Fluorescence analysis of haploid and diploid strains expressing KapB::GFP and/or KapA::mRFP showed patches of both karyopherins concurrently translocating long distances in apically-growing cells. Anterograde and retrograde movements allowed those patches to reach cell tips and distal regions with an average speed in the range of μm/s. This bidirectional traffic required microtubules as well as kinesin and dynein motors, since it is blocked by benomyl and also by the inactivation of the dynein/dynactin complex through nudA1 or nudK317 mutations. Deletion of Kinesin-3 motor UncA, required for the transport through detyrosinated microtubules, strongly inhibited KapA and KapB movement along hyphae. Overall, this is the first report describing the bidirectional dynamics of the main nuclear import system in coenocytic fungi. A functional link is proposed between two key cellular machines of the filamentous fungal cell: nuclear transport and the tip-growth apparatus.},

Current FG-centric views reason that selective Kap translocation is promoted by alterations in the barrier-like FG Nup conformations. However, the strong binding of Kaps with the FG Nups due to avidity contradicts rapid Kap translocation in vivo. Here, using surface plasmon resonance, we innovate a means to correlate in situ mechanistic (molecular occupancy and conformational changes) with equilibrium (binding affinity) and kinetic (multivalent binding kinetics) aspects of Karyopherinβ1 (Kapβ1) binding to four different FG Nups. A general feature of the FxFG domains of Nup214, Nup62, and Nup153 is their capacity to extend and accommodate large numbers of Kapβ1 molecules at physiological Kapβ1 concentrations. A notable exception is the GLFG domain of Nup98, which forms a partially penetrable cohesive layer. Interestingly, we find that a slowly exchanging Kapβ1 phase forms an integral constituent within the FG Nups that coexists with a fast phase, which dominates transport kinetics due to limited binding with the pre-occupied FG Nups at physiological Kapβ1 concentrations. Altogether, our data reveal an emergent Kap-centric barrier mechanism that may underlie mechanistic and kinetic control in the nuclear pore complex.},

The first approach is based on SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cells) using cells that have been treated or not with specific reagents, followed by subcellular fractionation. Applying this approach to cells treated with or without the selective CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B, we identified substrates of CRM1, the major nuclear export receptor. In the second SILAC approach, digitonin-permeabilized cells are incubated with nuclear and cytosolic extracts in the absence or presence of particular import receptors of interest. Proteomic analysis of the permeabilized cells then yields proteins whose nuclear import depends specifically on the added import receptor. Using this system, we identified substrates of two representative import receptors, transportin and importin-α/β.},

The FUS variant is defined by the presence of the fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in the pathological inclusions. However, similar to other FTLDs, the disease pathogenesis of FTLD-FUS remains largely poorly understood. Here we present data that the protein transportin1 (TRN1) is abundant in the FUS-positive inclusions. TRN1, the protein product of the TNP01 gene, is responsible for shuttling proteins containing an M9 nuclear localisation signal between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. RNA interacting proteins, including FUS, have been implicated as targets of TRN1. Using TRN1 immunohistochemistry and Western blotting in this study, we investigated 13 cases of FTLD-FUS including 6 cases with neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) and 7 atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusion (aFTLD-U) cases. The data from our immunohistochemical studies show that FUS-immunoreactive inclusions are also strongly labelled with the anti-TRN1 antibody and double-label immunofluorescence studies indicate good co-localisation between the FUS and TRN1 pathologies. Our biochemical investigations demonstrate that urea-soluble TRN1 is present in aFTLD-U and NIFID, but not in normal control brains. These findings implicate abnormalities of FUS transport in the pathogenesis of FTLD-FUS.},

Several proteins harboring these domains exhibit nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and possibly remain associated with their substrate RNAs bound in the nucleus during nuclear export. In the human RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1-c, the nuclear localization signal overlaps the third dsRBD, while the corresponding import factor is unknown. The protein also lacks a clear nuclear export signal but shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we identify transportin-1 as the import receptor for ADAR1. Interestingly, dsRNA binding interferes with transportin-1 binding. At the same time, each of the dsRBDs in ADAR1 interacts with the export factor exportin-5. RNA binding stimulates this interaction but is not a prerequisite. Thus, our data demonstrate a role for some dsRBDs as RNA-sensitive nucleocytoplasmic transport signals. dsRBD3 in ADAR1 can mediate nuclear import, while interaction of all dsRBDs might control nuclear export. This finding may have implications for other proteins containing dsRBDs and suggests a selective nuclear export mechanism for substrates interacting with these proteins.},

The binding affinity between Trn1 and FUS-NLS (wide-type and 12 ALS-associated mutants) was determined. As compared to the wide-type FUS-NLS (K(D) = 1.7 nM), each ALS-associated mutation caused a decreased affinity and the range of this reduction varied widely from 1.4-fold over 700-fold. The affinity of the mutants correlated with the extent of impaired nuclear localization, and more importantly, with the duration of disease progression in ALS patients.

This receptor-mediated process is essential to cellular viability as proteins are translated in the cytoplasm but many have functional roles in the nucleus. Many known karyopherin-β-cargo interactions were discovered through studies of the individual cargos rather than the karyopherins, and this information is thus widely scattered in the literature. We consolidate information about cargos that are directly recognized by import-karyopherin-βs and review common characteristics or lack thereof among cargos of different import pathways. Knowledge of karyopherin-β-cargo interactions is also critical for the development of nuclear import inhibitors and the understanding of their mechanisms of inhibition.

Over the past few years, significant progress has been made in the characterization of the nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that Transportin-1 recognizes, thereby providing the molecular basis of its diversified repertoire of cargoes.

These transport carriers are responsible for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of thousands of proteins, but the cargo allocation of each carrier, which is necessary information if one wishes to understand the physiological context of transport, is poorly characterized. To address this issue, we developed a high-throughput method to identify the cargoes of transport carriers by applying stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture to construct an in vitro transport system. Our method can be outlined in three steps. (1) Cells are cultured in a medium containing a stable isotope. (2) The cell membranes of the labeled cells are permeabilized, and proteins extracted from unlabeled cells are transported into the nuclei of the permeabilized cells. In this step, the reaction system is first depleted of all importin-β family carriers and then supplemented with a particular importin-β family carrier of interest. (3) Proteins in the nuclei are extracted and analyzed quantitatively via LC-MS/MS. As an important test case, we used this method to identify cargo proteins of transportin, a representative member of the importin-β family. As expected, the identified candidate cargo proteins included previously reported transportin cargoes as well as new potential cargoes, which we corroborated via in vitro binding assays. The identified cargoes are predominately RNA-interacting proteins, affirming that cargoes allotted to the same carrier share functional characteristics. Finally, we found that the transportin cargoes possessed at least two classes of signal sequences: the well characterized PY-nuclear localization signals specific for transportin, and Lys/Arg-rich segments capable of binding to both transportin and importin-β. Thus, our method will be useful for linking a carrier to features shared among its cargoes and to specific nuclear localization signals.},

Interaction and structural studies in the recent years have jointly revealed some general rules on the specificity determinants of the recognition of nuclear targeting signals by their specific receptors, at least for two nuclear import pathways: (i) the classical pathway, which involves the classical nuclear localization sequences (cNLSs) and the receptors importin-α/karyopherin-α and importin-β/karyopherin-β1; and (ii) the karyopherin-β2 pathway, which employs the proline-tyrosine (PY)-NLSs and the receptor transportin-1/karyopherin-β2.

	abstract = {Active transport between nucleus and cytoplasm proceeds through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and is mediated largely by shuttling transport receptors that use direct RanGTP binding to coordinate loading and unloading of cargo [1] [2] [3] [4]. Import receptors such as importin beta or transportin bind their substrates at low RanGTP levels in the cytoplasm and release them upon encountering RanGTP in the nucleus, where a high RanGTP concentration is predicted. This substrate release is, in the case of import by the importin alpha/beta heterodimer, coupled directly to importin beta release from the NPCs. If the importin beta -RanGTP interaction is prevented, import intermediates arrest at the nuclear side of the NPCs [5] [6]. This arrest makes it difficult to probe directly the Ran and energy requirements of the actual translocation from the cytoplasmic to the nuclear side of the NPC, which immediately precedes substrate release. Here, we have shown that in the case of transportin, dissociation of transportin-substrate complexes is uncoupled from transportin release from NPCs. This allowed us to dissect the requirements of translocation through the NPC, substrate release and transportin recycling. Surprisingly, translocation of transportin-substrate complexes into the nucleus requires neither Ran nor nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). It is only nuclear RanGTP, not GTP hydrolysis, that is needed for dissociation of transportin-substrate complexes and for re-export of transportin to the cytoplasm. GTP hydrolysis is apparently required only to restore the import competence of the re-exported transportin and, thus, for multiple rounds of transportin-dependent import. In addition, we provide evidence that at least one type of substrate can also complete NPC passage mediated by importin beta independently of Ran and energy.},

Thus, the Imp-βs mediate multiple, parallel transport pathways that can be regulated separately. In fact, the spatiotemporally differential expressions and the functional regulations of Imp-βs have been reported. Additionally, the biological significance of each pathway has been characterized by linking the function of a member of Imp-βs to a cellular consequence. Connecting these concepts, the regulation of the transport pathways conceivably induces alterations in the cellular physiological states. However, few studies have linked the regulation of an importin-β family NTR to an induced cellular response and the corresponding cargoes, despite the significance of this linkage in comprehending the biological relevance of the transport pathways. This review of recent reports on the regulation and biological functions of the Imp-βs highlights the significance of the transport pathways in physiological contexts and points out the possibility that the identification of yet unknown specific cargoes will reinforce the importance of transport regulation.},

Septins assemble into higher-order structures such as rings, bars, and gauzes with diverse functions including serving as membrane diffusion barriers and scaffolds for cell signaling. The basis for septin filament polymerization and the rules governing septin polymer dynamics are presently not well understood. Pharmacological agents are essential tools in studying such properties of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons however there are only limited reports of a drug specific to the septin cytoskeleton. Forchlorfenuron (FCF) is a synthetic plant cytokinin used in agriculture which has been shown to alter septin organization in yeast and mammalian tissue culture cells. Here we assess cellular requirements and properties of septin-based structures induced by FCF. Treatment of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii with FCF leads to assembly of extensive septin fibers throughout hyphae which is rapidly reversed upon removal of the drug. These fibers do not exchange or add septin subunits after assembly, indicating that FCF suppresses normal septin dynamics and stabilizes the polymers. While FCF-induced septin fibers do not co-localize to actin or microtubules, a polarized F-actin cytoskeleton is likely required for the assembly of drug-induced septin fibers. Thus, FCF is a potent inducer of septin polymerization and acts as a reversible stabilizer of extended septin polymers. This drug will be a powerful tool for studying mechanisms of septin polymerization and function, particularly in cell types where molecular analyses are complicated by the presence of multiple isoforms and limited genetics.},

Septins are associated with a system of 10 nm filaments at the S. cerevisiae bud neck, and heteromultimeric septin complexes have been isolated from cell extracts in a filamentous state 2, 3 and 4. A number of septins have been shown to bind and hydrolyze guanine nucleotide 2, 5 and 6. However, the role of GTP binding and hydrolysis in filament formation has not been elucidated. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that not all the subunits of the septin complex are required for all aspects of septin function 3 and 7. To address these questions, we have reconstituted filament assembly in vitro by using a recombinant Xenopus septin, Xl Sept2. Filament assembly is GTP dependent; moreover, the coiled-coil domain common to most septins is not essential for filament formation. Septin polymerization is preceded by a lag phase, suggesting a cooperative assembly mechanism. The slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP-γ-S, also induces polymerization, indicating that polymerization does not require GTP hydrolysis. If the properties of Xl Sept2 filaments reflect those of native septin complexes, these results imply that the growth or stability of septin filaments, or both, is regulated by the state of bound nucleotide.},

Fluorescence collected from membranes that are deposited on these terraces is then used to measure the distance of the fluorescent probes from the silicon oxide surface. Here, we applied the method to measure the distance between supported lipid bilayers and the surface of oxidized silicon chips. For plain fluid phosphatidylcholine bilayers, this distance was 1.7 +/- 1.0 nm. The cleft distance was increased to 3.9 +/- 0.9 nm in bilayers that were supported on a 3400-Da polyethylene glycol cushion. This distance is close to the Flory distance (4.8 nm) that would be expected for a grafted random coil of this polymer. In a second application, the distance of a membrane-bound protein from the membrane surface was measured. The integral membrane protein syntaxin1A/SNAP25 (t-SNARE) was reconstituted into tethered polymer-supported bilayers. A soluble form of the green fluorescent protein/vesicle-associated membrane protein (GFP-VAMP) was bound to the reconstituted t-SNAREs. The distance of the GFP from the membrane surface was 16.5 +/- 2.8 nm, indicating an upright orientation of the rod-shaped t-SNARE/v-SNARE complex from the membrane surface.},

The four essential septins form a complex containing two copies of each, but their arrangement was not known. Single-particle analysis by EM confirmed that the heterooligomer is octameric and revealed that the subunits are arrayed in a linear rod. Identity of each subunit was determined by examining complexes lacking a given septin, by antibody decoration, and by fusion to marker proteins (GFP or maltose binding protein). The rod has the order Cdc11–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc10–Cdc10–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11 and, hence, lacks polarity. At low ionic strength, rods assemble end-to-end to form filaments but not when Cdc11 is absent or its N terminus is altered. Filaments invariably pair into long parallel “railroad tracks.” Lateral association seems to be mediated by heterotetrameric coiled coils between the paired C-terminal extensions of Cdc3 and Cdc12 projecting orthogonally from each filament. Shs1 may be able to replace Cdc11 at the end of the rod. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the function and regulation of cellular septin structures.},

Using this method, we directly measured the tensile strength of a filament (the force necessary to break the bond between two actin monomers) and the force required for a filament to be moved by myosin or its proteolytic fragment bound to a glass surface in the presence of ATP. The first result shows that the tensile strength of the F-actin-phalloidin complex is comparable with the average force exerted on a single thin filament in muscle fibres during isometric contraction. This force is increased only slightly by tropomyosin. The second measurement shows that the myosin head (subfragment-1) can produce the same ATP-dependent force as intact myosin. The magnitude of this force is comparable with that produced by each head of myosin in muscle during isometric contraction.},

Small molecule compounds that disrupt septin filament assembly are valuable tools for dissecting septin functions with high temporal control. To date, forchlorfenuron (FCF) is the only compound known to affect septin assembly and functions. FCF dampens the dynamics of septin assembly inducing the formation of enlarged stable polymers, but the underlying mechanism of action is unknown. To investigate how FCF binds and affects septins, we performed in silico simulations of FCF docking to all available crystal structures of septins. Docking of FCF with SEPT2 and SEPT3 indicated that FCF interacts preferentially with the nucleotide-binding pockets of septins. Strikingly, FCF is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with residues involved in GDP-binding, mimicking nucleotide binding. FCF docking with the structure of SEPT2-GppNHp, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, and SEPT7 showed that FCF may assume two alternative non-overlapping conformations deeply into and on the outer side of the nucleotide-binding pocket. Surprisingly, FCF was predicted to interact with the P-loop Walker A motif GxxxxGKS/T, which binds the phosphates of GTP, and the GTP specificity motif AKAD, which interacts with the guanine base of GTP, and highly conserved amino acids including a threonine, which is critical for GTP hydrolysis. Thus, in silico FCF exhibits a conserved mechanism of binding, interacting with septin signature motifs and residues involved in GTP binding and hydrolysis. Taken together, our results suggest that FCF stabilizes septins by locking them into a conformation that mimics a nucleotide-bound state, preventing further GTP binding and hydrolysis. Overall, this study provides the first insight into how FCF may bind and stabilize septins, and offers a blueprint for the rational design of FCF derivatives that could target septins with higher affinity and specificity.},

The septins are conserved, GTP-binding proteins important for cytokinesis, membrane compartmentalization, and exocytosis. However, it is unknown how septins are arranged within higher-order structures in cells. To determine the organization of septins in live cells, we developed a polarized fluorescence microscopy system to monitor the orientation of GFP dipole moments with high spatial and temporal resolution. When GFP was fused to septins, the arrangement of GFP dipoles reflected the underlying septin organization. We demonstrated in a filamentous fungus, a budding yeast, and a mammalian epithelial cell line that septin proteins were organized in an identical highly ordered fashion. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicated that septin filaments organized into pairs within live cells, just as has been observed in vitro. Additional support for the formation of pairs came from the observation of paired filaments at the cortex of cells using electron microscopy. Furthermore, we found that highly ordered septin structures exchanged subunits and rapidly rearranged. We conclude that septins assemble into dynamic, paired filaments in vivo and that this organization is conserved from yeast to mammals.},

Remarkably, septins participate in a spectrum of cellular processes including cytokinesis, ciliogenesis, cell migration, polarity, and cell–pathogen interactions.

Despite their conserved role in cell organization, little is known about how septin filaments elongate and are knitted together into higher-order assemblies. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we determined that cytosolic septins are in small complexes, suggesting that septin filaments are not formed in the cytosol. When the plasma membrane of live cells is monitored by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we see that septin complexes of variable size diffuse in two dimensions. Diffusing septin complexes collide and make end-on associations to form elongated filaments and higher-order structures, an assembly process we call annealing. Septin assembly by annealing can be reconstituted in vitro on supported lipid bilayers with purified septin complexes. Using the reconstitution assay, we show that septin filaments are highly flexible, grow only from free filament ends, and do not exchange subunits in the middle of filaments. This work shows that annealing is a previously unidentified intrinsic property of septins in the presence of membranes and demonstrates that cells exploit this mechanism to build large septin assemblies.},

The current paradigm holds that prebound class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIP) and all subsequent antigens maintain a canonical orientation in the MHCII binding groove. Here we provide evidence for MHCII-bound CLIP inversion. NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that the interconversion from the canonical to the inverse alignment is a dynamic process, and X-ray crystallography shows that conserved MHC residues form a hydrogen bond network with the peptide backbone in both orientations. The natural catalyst HLA-DM accelerates peptide reorientation and the exchange of either canonically or inversely bound CLIP against antigenic peptide. Thus, noncanonical MHC-CLIP displays the hallmarks of a structurally and functionally intact antigen-presenting complex.},

We report that human tumor cells spontaneously release a soluble form of MICA encompassing the three extracellular domains, which is present at high levels in sera of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, but not in healthy donors. Release of MICA from tumor cells is blocked by inhibition of metalloproteinases, concomitantly causing accumulation of MICA on the cell surface. Shedding of MICA by tumor cells may modulate NKG2D-mediated tumor immune surveillance. In addition, determination of soluble MICA levels may be implemented as an immunological diagnostic marker in patients with epithelial malignancies.},

	abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

	abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms.

	abstract = {In this study, a fluorometric method using alamarBlue has been developed for detecting cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro. AlamarBlue is a non-toxic metabolic indicator of viable cells that becomes fluorescent upon mitochondrial reduction. Specific lysis of targets by effector cells is quantified by comparing the total number of viable cells in wells containing effector and targets together, with wells where target and effector cells were separately seeded. Cell-mediated cytotoxic activity by alloreactive T cells and natural killer cells has been detected using a novel application of the alamarBlue technique. The assay that we have developed to detect cell-mediated cytotoxicity is extremely sensitive and specific and requires a significant lower number of effector cells than the standard 51Cr assay. Since alamarBlue reagent is non-toxic to cells and the assay can be performed under sterile conditions, effector cells may be recovered at the end for further analysis or cell expansion, if desired. Direct comparison of cell-mediated cytotoxicity measured by the alamarBlue method with the standard 51Cr release assay revealed that the former method is as specific and more sensitive than the conventional assay. Moreover, very small inter and intra-assay variations have been observed for alamarBlue cytotoxicity assays. In conclusion, this study shows that the alamarBlue assay is an extremely sensitive, economical, simple and non-toxic procedure to evaluate cell-mediated cytotoxicity that yields accurate results using a limited number of effector cells. Furthermore, since this assay is a one-step procedure, and does not involve any risk for the personnel, it may be useful to analyze automatically cell-mediated cytotoxicity in a large number of samples.},

Here, we show that the viral gene product UL142 is able to down-regulate another NKG2D ligand, MICA, leading to protection from NK cytotoxicity. UL142 is not able to affect surface expression of all MICA alleles, however, which may reflect selective pressure on the host to thwart viral immune evasion, further supporting an important role for the MICA–NKG2D interaction in immune surveillance.},

In humans, NKG2D is expressed on most natural killer cells, γδ T cells and CD8αβ T cells. Ligands of NKG2D include the major histocompatibility complex class I homologues MICA and MICB, which function as signals of cellular stress. These molecules are absent from most cells and tissues but can be induced by viral and bacterial infections and are frequently expressed in epithelial tumours. MIC engagement of NKG2D triggers natural killer cells and costimulates antigen-specific effector T cells. Here we show that binding of MIC induces endocytosis and degradation of NKG2D. Expression of NKG2D is reduced markedly on large numbers of tumour-infiltrating and matched peripheral blood T cells from individuals with cancer. This systemic deficiency is associated with circulating tumour-derived soluble MICA, causing the downregulation of NKG2D and in turn severe impairment of the responsiveness of tumour-antigen-specific effector T cells. This mode of T-cell silencing may promote tumour immune evasion and, by inference, compromise host resistance to infections.},

	abstract = {NKG2D, together with NKp46 and NKp30, represents a major triggering receptor involved in the induction of cytotoxicity by both resting and activated human natural killer cells. In this study, we analyzed the expression and the functional relevance of MHC class I-related chain A (MICA) and UL16 binding protein (ULBP), the major cellular ligands for human NKG2D, in human tumor cell lines of different histological origin. We show that MICA and ULBP are frequently coexpressed by carcinoma cell lines, whereas MICA is expressed more frequently than ULBP by melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, the MICA− ULBP+ phenotype was detected in most T cell leukemia cell lines, whereas the MICA− ULBP− phenotype characterized all acute myeloid leukemia and most B-cell lymphoma cell lines analyzed. These results, together with functional experiments, based on monoclonal antibody-mediated blocking of either NKG2D or its ligands, showed that killing of certain MICA− cell tumors is at least in part NKG2D dependent. Indeed, leukemic T cells as well as certain B-cell lymphomas were killed in a NKG2D-dependent fashion upon recognition of ULBP molecules. Moreover, ULBP could induce NKG2D-mediated NK cell triggering also in tumors coexpressing MICA. Our data suggest that the involvement of NKG2D in natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity strictly correlates with the expression and the surface density of MICA and ULBP on target cell tumors of different histotypes.},

	abstract = {Background Large granular lymphocyte leukemia is a semi-autonomous clonal proliferation of cytotoxic T cells accompanied by immune cytopenias and various autoimmune conditions. Due to the rarity of this disease and its association with autoimmune diseases, a theoretical germline or somatic mutation might have significant penetrance, thus enabling detection, even from samples of suboptimal size, through genome-wide association studies.
Design and Methods To investigate a non-mendelian genetic predisposition to large granular lymphocyte leukemia, we used a step-wise method for gene discovery. First, a modified ‘random forests’ technique was used for candidate gene identification: this was followed by traditional allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, sequencing modalities, and mechanistic assays.
Results Our analysis found an association with MICA, a non-peptide-presenting, tightly regulated, stress-induced MHC-like molecule and cognate receptor for NKG2D, found abundantly on large granular lymphocyte leukemia cells. Sequencing of germline DNA revealed a higher frequency of MICA*00801/A5.1 in patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia than in matched controls (64\% versus 41\%, P{\textless}0.001, homozygous 40\% versus 15\%, P{\textless}0.001). Flow cytometry was employed to determine the expression of MICA within hematologic compartments, showing that the signal intensity of MICA was increased in granulocytes from neutropenic patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia in comparison with that in controls (P=0.033). Furthermore, neutrophil counts were inversely correlated with MICA expression (R2=0.50, P=0.035). Finally, large granular lymphocyte leukemia cells were able to selectively kill MICA+ Ba/F3 lymphocytes transfected with human MICA*019 in a dose-dependent manner compared to naïve cells (P{\textless}0.001), an effect mitigated by administration of an anti-NKG2D antibody (P=0.033).
Conclusions Our results illustrate that MICA-NKG2D played a role in disease pathogenesis in the majority of patients in our cohort of cases of large granular lymphocyte leukemia and further investigation into this signaling axis may provide potent therapeutic targets.},

They may thus play a central role in the immune surveillance of damaged, infected, or otherwise stressed intestinal epithelial cells. However, the generality of this system in evolution and the mode of recognition of MICA and MICB are undefined. Analysis of cDNA sequences from various primate species defined translation products that are homologous to MICA and MICB. All of the MIC polypeptides have common characteristics, although they are extraordinarily diverse. The most notable alterations are several deletions and frequent amino acid substitutions in the putative α-helical regions of the α1α2 domains. However, the primate MIC molecules were expressed on the surfaces of normal and transfected cells. Moreover, despite their sharing of relatively few identical amino acids in potentially accessible regions of their α1α2 domains, they were recognized by diverse human intestinal epithelial γδ T cells that are restricted by MICA and MICB. Thus, MIC molecules represent a family of MHC proteins that are structurally diverse yet appear to be functionally conserved. The promiscuous mode of γδ T cell recognition of these antigens may be explained by their sharing of a single conserved interaction site.},

In addition to its primary role in immune surveillance, recent data highlight the importance of MICA in organ transplantation and in susceptibility to some diseases. In this study, 104 healthy, unrelated Han subjects recruited from central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, northern China, were investigated by sequence-based typing and fragment analysis for MICA allelic variation, MICA-HLA-B linkage disequilibrium, and HLA-A-Cw-B-MICA haplotypic diversity. Nineteen MICA alleles were observed, the most frequent of which were MICA*00801, MICA*010, MICA*00201, MICA*00901, and MICA*045, with gene frequencies of 23.08\%, 18.75\%, 12.02\%, 12.02\%, and 8.17\%, respectively. The peculiarity in HLA-B-MICA haplotypic configurations was also uncovered. In particular, there was a clear-cut dichotomy between MICA*00801 and MICA*045 in their linkage to members of HLA-B*13 lineage, which was frequently represented in this population. A new MICA allele, MICA*059, was identified, which appeared to be evolutionarily linked to MICA*045. Haplotype HLA-A*30-Cw*06-B*1302-MICA*00801, previously not reported in other populations, was found with a frequency of 8.65\% in this population. Our results provide new data about MICA genetic polymorphism in Chinese Han populations, which will form the basis for future studies of the potential role of MICA in allogeneic organ transplantation and disease susceptibility in related ethnic groups.},

However, both MIC-A and MIC-B are polymorphic, displaying an unusual distribution of a number of variant amino acids in their extracellular α1, α2, and α3 domains. In order to further define the polymorphism of MIC-A, we examined its alleles among 275 individuals with common and rare HLA genotypes. Of 16 previously defined alleles, 12 were confirmed and 5 new alleles were identified. A two-by-two analysis of MIC-A and HLA-B alleles uncovered a number of statistically significant associations. These results confirm and extend previous knowledge on the polymorphism of MIC-A.

In the present study, polymorphic exons 2, 3, and 4 of the MIC-A gene were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism method. The number of patterns found in exons 2, 3, and 4 were 5, 6, and 4, respectively, in 114 healthy Japanese subjects. Eight MIC-A alleles were observed in Japanese individuals, among which one, tentatively named MIC-AMW, has not previously been reported. There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between MIC-A and HLA-B loci: each MIC-A allele showed strong association with a particular HLA-B group. In contrast, B*3901 showed association with multiple MIC-A alleles. Furthermore, the existence of a MIC-A-MIC-B null haplotype, which is associated with HLA-B*4801, was identified. In this haplotype, a large-scale deletion (of approximately 100 kb) including the entire MIC-A gene was indicated and the MIC-B gene possessed a stop codon.},

MICA is structurally quite different from the HLA class I genes and is potentially associated with some diseases and with immune response to transplants. Some DNA-based typing techniques have previously been described for MICA including sequence-based typing (SBT) and analysis of single strand conformational polymorphisms (SSCP). In the present experiments we have developed a strategy that allows identification of all 54 MICA alleles described so far, using group-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP). To analyze for the polymorphisms in exons 2, 3, and 4 an initial screening with group-specific primers, based on polymorphism at position 69 of exon 2, and at position 615–616 of exon 4, was used to determine four major groups of alleles. Then group-specific PCR amplifications were performed and the amplified DNA was hybridized with the corresponding panels of SSOP. An additional amplification was performed with locus-specific primers and hybridized with a set of SSOP to identify and/or confirm the presence of some of the alleles. Unequivocal MICA typing was achieved for 97 of 103 individuals. Of 54 previously described alleles, only 14 were observed in this population. One unexpected hybridization pattern was observed, and molecular cloning and sequencing confirmed it to be a novel sequence, which was given the local designation MICA-055D. The gene frequencies among 103 unrelated North American Caucasian donors were determined and the linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B was analyzed.},

Present in both humans and mice, this highly conserved receptor binds to a surprisingly diverse family of ligands that are distant relatives of MHC-class-I molecules. There is increasing evidence that ligand expression can result in both immune activation (tumor clearance, viral immunity, autoimmunity, and transplantation) and immune silencing (tumor evasion). In this review, we describe this family of NKG2D ligands and the various mechanisms that control their expression in stressed and normal cells. We also discuss the host response to both membrane-bound and secreted NKG2D ligands and summarize the models proposed to explain the consequences of this differential expression.},

This study investigated the roles of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 9 (ADAM9) in the shedding of MICA in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown (KD) of ADAM9 resulted in up-regulation of membrane-bound MICA expression on the HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cellular surfaces and down-regulation of soluble MICA levels in their culture supernatant. ADAM9 was cleaved at a site between Gln347 and Val348 of MICA in vitro. We constructed a plasmid of the MICA gene with mutation or deletion of the ADAM9 cleavage site to examine the detailed mechanism of MICA shedding by ADAM9 protease. The results suggested that MICA might be cleaved at the intracellular ADAM9-recognized cleavage site and was further cleaved at the extracellular ADAM9-independent cleavage site in HCC cells, resulting in the production of soluble MICA. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ADAM9 was overexpressed in human HCC compared to normal liver tissues. The cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells against ADAM9KD-HCC cells was higher than that against control cells, and the enhancement of this cytotoxicity depended on the MICA/B and NK group 2, member D pathway. Sorafenib treatment resulted in decreased expression of ADAM9, increased expression of membrane-bound MICA expression, and decreased levels of soluble MICA in HCC cells. Adding sorafenib enhanced the NK sensitivity of HCC cells via increased expression of membrane-bound MICA. Conclusion: ADAM9 is involved in MICA ectodomain shedding in HCC cells, and sorafenib can modulate ADAM9 expression.

Shedding of MICA by tumor cells facilitates tumor immune evasion, which may in part contribute to tumor progression. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms by which tumors shed MIC is of great importance for therapy to reinforce NK and T cell antitumor immunity. In this study, we report that the membrane type matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14 mediates MICA shedding. Suppression of MMP14 expression blocks MICA shedding. Concomitantly, overexpression of MMP14 enhances MICA shedding. The regulation of MICA shedding by MMP14 is independent of the activity of a disintegrin and metalloproteinases, which have been reported to mediate MICA shedding. Finally, MMP14 expression in MICA-positive tumor cells regulates the sensitivity of tumor cells to NK cell killing. These findings suggest that MMP14 may be a new target for tumor immune therapy.},

Thus, the presence of MICA/B on transformed cells contributes to tumor immunosurveillance. Consequently, the proteolytic cleavage of MICA/B is regarded as an important immune escape mechanism of various cancer cells. To investigate the molecular machinery responsible for the shedding of endogenous MICA/B, we analyzed different human tumor entities including mammary, pancreatic and prostate carcinomas. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that all tested tumor cells constitutively expressed MICA and MICB on the cell surface and also released NKG2D ligands into the supernatant. We demonstrate that the “a disintegrin and metalloproteases” (ADAMs) 10 and 17 are largely responsible for the generation of soluble MICA/B. Pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases reduced the level of released MICA/B and increased cell surface expression. Studies using RNA interference not only revealed a prominent role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in NKG2D ligand shedding but also a tumor cell-specific role of ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 in shedding of MICA or MICB. Moreover, we report that in the prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3, MICA was not shed at all but rather was secreted in exosomes. These data indicate that the release of NKG2D ligands from individual tumor entities is by far more complex than suggested in previously reported MICA/B transfection systems.},

	abstract = {The immunoreceptor NKG2D promotes immunosurveillance of malignant cells and protects the host from tumor initiation by activating natural killer cells and costimulating CD8 T cells. NKG2D-mediated recognition of malignant cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes is enabled through the tumor-associated expression of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) resulting from cellular or genotoxic stress. Shedding of NKG2DL is thought to constitute a major countermechanism of tumor cells to subvert NKG2D-mediated immunosurveillance. Here, we report that the prototypical NKG2DL MICA is released by proteolytic cleavage in the stalk of the MICA ectodomain, where deletions, but not alanine substitutions, impede MICA shedding. Small compound-mediated stimulation and inhibition of MICA shedding adduced characteristics that indicated an involvement of members of the “a disintegrin and metalloproteinase” (ADAM) family. Accordingly, MICA shedding by tumor cells was inhibited by silencing of the related ADAM10 and ADAM17 proteases, which are known to promote tumor growth by releasing epidermal growth factor receptor ligands. Collectively, our data show that ADAM10 and ADAM17 are critically involved in the tumor-associated proteolytic release of soluble MICA facilitating tumor immune escape. Hence, therapeutic blockade of ADAM10 and ADAM17 seems promising for cancer treatment by targeting both growth and immune escape of tumors. [Cancer Res 2008;68(15):6368–76]},

The recognition on target cells of NKG2D ligands leads to the activation of lysis and cytokine secretion by NK cells and T cells. Besides being expressed at the cell surface, MICA/B can be released as soluble proteins. Soluble NKG2D ligands downmodulate expression of the NKG2D receptor on lymphocytes, leading to a diminished cytotoxic response. Prior studies suggested that recruitment of MICA/B molecules to cholesterol-enriched microdomains was an important factor regulating the proteolytic release of these molecules. We now show that recruitment of MICA to these microdomains depends on palmitoylation of two cysteine residues that allow MICA molecules to reside in the membrane in the same domains as caveolin-1. Compared with WT molecules, nonpalmitoylated mutant MICA molecules were shed to the supernatant with low efficiency; however, both WT and mutant MICA were able to trigger NK cell cytotoxicity. These data suggest that the presence of NKG2D ligands at the plasma membrane is sufficient to activate cytotoxicity and reflect the need of different ligands to exploit different cellular pathways to reach the cell surface upon different stress situations.},

Ligands for human NKG2D comprise two groups of MHC class I-related molecules, the MHC class I chain-related proteins A and B (MICA/B) and 6 UL16-binding proteins (ULBP1-6). While NKG2D ligands are absent from most normal cells, expression is induced upon stress and malignant transformation. In fact, most solid tumours and leukaemia/lymphomas constitutively express at least one NKG2D ligand and thereby are susceptible to NKG2D-dependent immunosurveillance. However, soluble NKG2D ligands are released from tumour cells and can down-modulate NKG2D activation as a means of tumour immune escape. In some tumour entities, levels of soluble NKG2D ligands in the serum correlate with tumour progression. NKG2D ligands can be proteolytically shed from the cell surface or liberated from the membrane by phospholipase C in the case of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules. Moreover, NKG2D ligands can be secreted in exosomal microvesicles together with other tumour-derived molecules. Depending on the specific tumour/immune cell setting, these various forms of soluble and/or exosome-bound NKG2D ligands can exert multiple effects on NKG2D/NKG2D ligand interactions. In this review, we focus on the role of various proteases in the shedding of human NKG2D ligands from tumour cells and discuss the not completely unanimous reported functional implications of soluble and exosome-secreted NKG2D ligands for immunosurveillance.},

Although similar to other MICA/B molecules in the extracellular domain, the predicted transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of MICA*008 are quite different, and this difference seemed to be critical for the mode of release from tumor cells. Treatment of natural killer (NK) cells with exosomes containing MICA*008 molecules not only triggered downregulation of NKG2D from the cell surface but also provoked a marked reduction in NK cytotoxicity that is independent of NKG2D ligand expression by the target cell.

	abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes typically encode polymorphic peptide-binding chains which are ubiquitously expressed and mediate the recognition of intracellular antigens by cytotoxic T cells. They constitute diverse gene families in different species and include the numerous so-called nonclassical genes in the mouse H-2 complex, of which some have been adapted to variously modified functions. We have identified a distinct family of five related sequences in the human MHC which are distantly homologous to class I chains. These MIC genes (MHC class I chain-related genes) evolved in parallel with the human class I genes and with those of most if not all mammalian orders. The MICA gene in this family is located near HLA-B and is by far the most divergent mammalian MHC class I gene known. It is further distinguished by its unusual exon-intron organization and preferential expression in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. However, the presence of diagnostic residues in the MICA amino acid sequence translated from cDNA suggests that the putative MICA chain folds similarly to typical class I chains and may have the capacity to bind peptide or other short ligands. These results define a second lineage of evolutionarily conserved MHC class I genes. This implies that MICA and possibly other members in this family have been selected for specialized functions that are either ancient or derived from those of typical MHC class I genes, in analogy to some of the nonclassical mouse H-2 genes.},

In this study, we investigated the effect of inhibitors targeting the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) on the expression of NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. GSK3 is a pleiotropic serine-threonine kinase point of convergence of numerous cell-signaling pathways, able to regulate the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, including MM. We found that inhibition of GSK3 upregulates both MICA protein surface and mRNA expression in MM cells, with little or no effects on the basal expression of the MICB and DNAM-1 ligand poliovirus receptor/CD155. Moreover, exposure to GSK3 inhibitors renders myeloma cells more efficient to activate NK cell degranulation and to enhance the ability of myeloma cells to trigger NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. We could exclude that increased expression of β-catenin or activation of the heat shock factor-1 (transcription factors inhibited by active GSK3) is involved in the upregulation of MICA expression, by using RNA interference or viral transduction of constitutive active forms. On the contrary, inhibition of GSK3 correlated with a downregulation of STAT3 activation, a negative regulator of MICA transcription. Both Tyr(705) phosphorylation and binding of STAT3 on MICA promoter are reduced by GSK3 inhibitors; in addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of STAT3 significantly inhibits MICA upregulation. Thus, we provide evidence that regulation of the NKG2D-ligand MICA expression may represent an additional immune-mediated mechanism supporting the antimyeloma activity of GSK3 inhibitors.},

	abstract = {The aim of binding assays is to measure interactions between two molecules, such as a protein binding another protein, a small molecule, or a nucleic acid. Hard work is required to prepare reagents, but flaws in the design of many binding experiments limit the information obtained. In particular many experiments fail to measure the affinity of the reactants for each other. This essay describes simple methods to get the most out of valuable reagents in binding experiments.},
